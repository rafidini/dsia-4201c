<p>Supermarket support and rising use of sexed semen expected to help UK farmers meet new welfare rules by the end of 2021</p><p class="css-vdb1rb">Last modified on Thu 10 Dec 2020 09.44 GMT</p><p class="css-38z03z">Dairy farmers have until the end of next year to prove they are no longer killing male calves on-farm under new rules which will apply to nearly all UK farms from January, the Guardian has learned.<br><br>The number of male calves being killed straight after birth, known as the “dirty secret” among farmers, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/26/dairy-dirty-secret-its-still-cheaper-to-kill-male-calves-than-to-rear-them" data-link-name="in body link">prompted outrage</a> from animal welfare groups and many within the farming sector. <br><br>A Guardian investigation in 2018 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/26/dairy-dirty-secret-its-still-cheaper-to-kill-male-calves-than-to-rear-them" data-link-name="in body link">estimated</a> that 95,000 were being killed every year within a few days of birth. The lack of viable markets for bull calves and public apathy towards consuming British rosé veal had meant it was sometimes cheaper to kill calves rather than rear them.<br><br>However, a rise in the use of sexed semen, which dramatically reduces the number of male calves born, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/21/morrisons-moves-to-end-killing-of-male-calves-at-birth" data-link-name="in body link">new retailer policies</a> to help farmers find markets for their calves is leading to a fall in animals being killed.<br><br>Around 60,000 male calves are now killed on-farm every year, according to industry <a href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/gb-cattle-health-welfare-group-fifth-report-2020" data-link-name="in body link">estimates</a>, which is around 15% of the bull calves born on dairy farms. But this figure is expected to drop significantly with new rules restricting the killing of calves coming into force from next year.</p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="css-38z03z">All farms covered by the Red Tractor standards (the scheme applies to <a href="https://assurance.redtractor.org.uk/contentfiles/Farmers-7030.pdf?_=637007702215553419" data-link-name="in body link">95% of milk produced</a> in the UK) will have to have written breeding and management policies in place and maintain data on all births and deaths, according to new rules due to be announced imminently. The new standards state farms will be banned from the “routine euthanasia of calves”. <br><br>The rules come into force on 1 January, but a spokesperson for Red Tractor told the Guardian this week that farmers would have until the end of next year to meet the standards. <br><br>A steady increase in the use of sexed semen since the early 1990s has recently seen sales jumping from 18% in 2017 to more than 50% of total semen sales in 2020. Industry figures expect it to completely replace conventional semen within five years.<br><br>“It’s been a gamechanger,” said Andrew Suddes, a farm consultant for Promar. “Farmers are able to produce heifer [female] calves more easily. You can now produce the replacement heifers that you need with sexed semen, and use beef semen on the rest [of the cows] to produce calves that can be better kept and reared for beef.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">Although sexed semen increases costs for farmers, it can reduce the proportion of male calves being born to less than 10%. <br><br>A number of retailers have already banned the killing of male dairy calves or their export overseas from farms in their supply chains. Retailers including Sainsbury’s, Co-op, Waitrose, Marks &amp; Spencer and Morrisons now have calf schemes in place to help ensure rearing dairy bull calves is economically viable for farmers. <br><br><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/21/morrisons-moves-to-end-killing-of-male-calves-at-birth" data-link-name="in body link">In the case of Morrisons</a>, farmers are required to rear the calves to a certain weight until 15–40 days of age, at which point they will be bought by a beef-rearing company. The retailer also committed to buying calves born on farms under bovine tuberculosis restrictions, which leave farmers with few markets to sell to. <br><br><em>Sign up for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/animals-farmed/2018/feb/21/animals-farmed-join-us-for-monthly-updates-newsletter-updates" data-link-name="in body link">Animals farmed monthly update</a> to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

<p>Air quality found to be worse than before pandemic in 80% of cities and large towns analysed</p><p class="css-vdb1rb">Last modified on Thu 10 Dec 2020 12.40 GMT</p><p class="css-38z03z">Air pollution in many towns and cities across the UK now exceeds pre-pandemic levels, exacerbating the risk of Covid-19 and putting the health of millions of people at risk.</p><p class="css-38z03z">A <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/publication/covid-pandemic-lockdown-air-quality-cities/" data-link-name="in body link">study</a> published on Thursday says that although air quality improved dramatically in the first half of the year as the country went into lockdown, pollution now meets or exceeds pre-Covid levels in 80% of the 49 cities and large towns that were analysed.</p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="css-38z03z">There is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/04/tiny-air-pollution-rise-linked-to-11-more-covid-19-deaths-study" data-link-name="in body link">growing evidence</a> that exposure to toxic air increases the risks from Covid-19 and the authors of the study say their findings underscore the need for local councils to do more to reduce car use and improve air quality by prioritising walking and cycling.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities thinktank, which carried out the study, said toxic air contributed to the deaths of thousands of Covid-19 victims this year and, even after the pandemic ended, would remain a big threat to public health – particularly for those living in urban areas.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“City leaders can reduce the threat of air pollution, but it will take political will,” said Carter. “Discouraging car usage will be unpopular in the short term but, if coupled with the necessary improvements to public transport, the long-term benefits to public health and the economy will be huge and our cities will become better places to live in. Now is not the time for politicians to delay on this.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">The study’s findings, based on an analysis of the latest data from Defra, reveal that while the spring lockdown reduced nitrogen dioxide<sub> </sub>levels by 38% on average across 49 cities and large towns, pre-pandemic levels had been reached or exceeded in four-fifths of the places studied during the second half of 2020.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The authors say the surge in toxic air has been driven by a rise in the use of private cars and has happened even though 98% of the country remains under significant Covid-19 restrictions. This raises concerns that as those measures are eased in the new year, air quality will worsen even further, with dire consequences for public health.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Since the pandemic hit, many local authorities <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/24/schemes-boosting-cycling-and-working-accelerate-across-the-uk" data-link-name="in body link">have tried to encourage walking and cycling</a> by building cycle lanes and creating low-traffic neighbourhoods to stop drivers “rat-running” through residential areas.</p><p class="css-38z03z">But these efforts have faced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2020/oct/22/despite-a-loud-opposing-minority-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-are-increasingly-popular" data-link-name="in body link">vocal opposition</a> from the pro-car lobby and some disgruntled drivers. Some councils have already backed down, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/30/kensington-and-chelsea-council-criticised-for-scrapping-cycle-lane" data-link-name="in body link">pulling up new cycle lanes</a>, while others <a href="https://airqualitynews.com/2020/08/19/leeds-clean-air-zone-suspended-for-foreseable-future/" data-link-name="in body link">shelved long-term plans</a> to install low-emission zones, arguing that pollution levels had already fallen due to the lockdown.</p><p class="css-38z03z">But Hubert Thieriot, from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said the new study highlighted the need for local leaders across the country to step up their efforts to limit the use of private cars as the country emerged from lockdown restrictions.</p><p class="css-38z03z">He said the pandemic had caused “immense suffering both on sanitary and social fronts” but it had also reminded the public “that air pollution is not a given, and that bold actions on transportation could significantly improve people’s health and quality of life”.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“The role of transportation in UK cities’ air pollution has become apparent to everyone during the Covid-related lockdowns,” Thieriot said. “That shared awareness offers policymakers a historical chance to implement bold transportation policies.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">• This article was amended on 10 December 2020. An earlier version said the Centre for Cities study found that in 80% of UK cities and large towns analysed, air pollution exceeded pre-pandemic levels. In fact that figure relates to air pollution meeting or exceeding pre-pandemic levels.</p><br>

<p><strong>Sandy, Bedfordshire:</strong> Round and round circled the crows, an audience looking for an event<br></p><p class="css-vdb1rb">Last modified on Wed 9 Dec 2020 13.06 GMT</p><p class="css-38z03z"><span class="css-17ehqsd"><span class="css-1ljoi60">W</span></span><span class="css-38z03z">alls, windows and a mid-morning cuppa break were no defence against a rising rush of sound that demanded investigation. The hiss and swish, like a battering hailstorm but on a blue-sky day, arose from somewhere out of doors. It flushed us out into the back garden – a mistake. A dozen or so jackdaws zipped over, and they were heading for the main action, towards a swell that came from over the other side of the rooftop.</span></p><p class="css-38z03z">We raced back through the house and opened the front door to a sky darkened with crows. I hazarded a hundred, but it could have been twice that number. The jackdaws flocked by disciplined instinct and swilled around half a dozen lime trees, quilting the air with vapourless trails. A few carrion crows mingled among them, but they abided by no rules, often beating across the jackdaw traffic. I saw one lumpen hulk of a crow collide with its smaller cousin, sending it into an open-winged cartwheel. The magpies stayed true to their ancestry as forest birds and jumped, as if nervously, from branch to branch.</p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="css-38z03z">The sight was as nothing compared with the mob music that brayed out of this soup of corvids. The daws lengthened their “jack” calls, lacing them with excitement or anxiety; some even gave orgiastic yelps. One of the magpies sank its familiar high ack-ack rattle into a low slow drill, a purr with menace. The crows – well, I couldn’t hear them above the din.</p><p class="css-38z03z">What was all this commotion about? Round and round the limes circled the crows, an audience looking for an event. A man passing with two perplexed-looking sons in tow offered a witness statement: “The magpies have got something dead on the roof.” But we could see nothing at all on any roof. The accused in black and white had ganged up by now, seven for a secret never to be told perching on the rungs of one lime, while two for joy occupied its neighbour. They fell silent, and waited.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Nothing to see, move on. The clamour overhead had dropped to a hush, the birds melted away. The tension had gone out of the scene, the heat had gone out of my teacup.</p><br>

<p>Party supporters and activists warn inaction over its green new deal could harm electoral chances<br></p><p class="css-vdb1rb">Last modified on Wed 9 Dec 2020 04.37 GMT</p><p class="css-38z03z">Labour risks losing support among young people unless it does more to champion a radical green new deal (GND) to tackle the climate crisis and rebuild the post-Covid economy with well-paid, unionised jobs, according to climate activists and young <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Labour</a> supporters.</p><p class="css-38z03z">School climate strikers and key youth groups within the party say they have been dismayed by what they see as the party’s failure to fight for the full “green industrial revolution” programme set out at the last election. And they warn that the party risks losing support among young people who have backed Labour in the past few years.</p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="css-38z03z">Joe Brindle, 18, an organiser of school climate strikes in the UK, said many young people who were deeply concerned about climate breakdown were becoming disillusioned with Labour.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“It is just really disappointing … The leadership will say that the GND is central to what they are doing but they hardly ever bring it up.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“Before the election it felt like their number one priority, it was absolutely central to everything the party talking about, but now it is hardly ever mentioned and it is becoming hard to persuade people concerned about climate change that the Labour party is their best option.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">Labour insisted that it remained committed to a radical environment programme to decarbonise the economy and tackle the climate crisis, adding it should be judged on its policies at the next election.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Ed Miliband, the shadow energy minister, said: “Climate and the green agenda are absolutely central to Labour’s plan for our economy, society and country. We want to be judged at the next election by our ambition in tackling the climate crisis.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">But the campaign group Labour for a Green New Deal said the party’s recent <a href="https://labour.org.uk/page/green-recovery-report/" data-link-name="in body link">green economic recovery</a> plan appeared to water down or abandon key planks of the previous manifesto – such as public ownership of energy companies, levels of investment, the number of homes that would receive retrofitting and solar panels, and the number of well-paid unionised jobs a GND could create.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Lauren Townsend, spokesperson for the group, which was instrumental in getting the party to back the 2019 GND policy, said: “Labour might claim it’s building on the 2019 manifesto, but in reality the party’s climate policies are going backwards. Labour’s green recovery plan abandons a 2030 decarbonisation target, scraps key public ownership commitments and fails to take on the corporate actors driving the climate crisis.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">She said this was not just a failure to address the scale of the climate crisis but would also be hugely damaging to Labour’s electoral chances.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“By scaling back its climate ambitions, Labour risks losing an election-winning coalition, ranging from Brighton to Bolsover. The green new deal agenda offers jobs, investment and security to working-class communities across the country, and last year made Labour the party of climate. Watering down our ambitions isn’t just bad for the planet – it’s bad politics.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">However, a spokesperson for Labour said it remained committed to a radical green new deal including the target to achieve the substantial majority of emissions reductions by 2030 and the nationalisation of the energy sector as set out at the last election. They said its recent green recovery plan was just a short term response to the Covid crisis, adding the party should be judged on the full green new deal it puts forward at the next election.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Miliband insisted the party was fully committed to a transformative agenda.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“That’s why our green economic plan challenged the government to bring forward £30bn capital investment in the next 18 months to support hundreds of thousands of new jobs in low-carbon sectors, in line with ambitious independent proposals.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">He said this was “just the start” of the party’s plans for a GND which “must both decarbonise our economy and transform our country.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">“We want to see much greater ambition in the scale and pace of the UK’s approach to the climate emergency, including eliminating the substantial majority of our emissions by 2030, exactly the same call we made in the 2019 manifesto.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">But Jess Barnard, chair of Young Labour, which represents members aged 14-26 said the party had failed to lead on the issue that mattered most to young people since last year’s general election.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“We really have not seen very much from Keir [Starmer] in his time as leader around the climate crisis.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">She said there was growing concern among many younger voters who backed the party at the last election.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“At the moment we really risk disenfranchising younger voters because they felt they had this ally in Labour and now we are suddenly absent from the debate, absent from opposition, we are absent from demanding action.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">Gaya Sriskanthan, co-chair of Momentum, the grassroots campaign group which backed Jeremy Corbyn for leader, said it appeared Labour was no longer listening to young people or the trade unions on the issue of a green new deal.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“The most fundamental question here is who is Labour listening to on this, who is informing its policy because it is not the membership, it is not the unions it is not the youth strikers.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">She said an increased focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the role of hydrogen in Labour’s recent green recovery plan would be welcomed by big oil.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“The fact that they are emphasising CCS and hydrogen is very curious – because these are exactly the sort of things the fossil fuel industry push because they want to focus on things that don’t challenge their fundamental power.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">Labour denied the claim and said it was committed to working with members, unions and climate activists to tackle the crisis.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Some MPs are also calling on the Labour leadership to do more to push a radical climate justice agenda.</p><p class="css-38z03z"> Zarah Sultana, Labour MP for Coventry South, said: “This should be a 1945 moment, with Labour promising a radical green new deal to rebuild the economy with climate and social justice at its heart. Anything less risks not only losing support from young people, but also of abandoning the hope to avert the climate catastrophe.”</p><br>

<p>Production of concrete, metal, plastic, bricks and asphalt greater than mass of living matter on planet, paper says</p><p class="css-vdb1rb">Last modified on Wed 9 Dec 2020 16.02 GMT</p><p class="css-38z03z">The giant human footprint stamped across the world in 2020 is greater than the impact on the planet of all other living things, research suggests.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The amount of plastic alone is greater in mass than all land animals and marine creatures combined, the study estimates.</p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="css-38z03z">While human beings might believe in “the immensity of the globe and the seeming infinity of the natural world”, the researchers say they wanted to provide an objective and rigorous measure of the reality of the balance between man and nature.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Their research shows that human activity including production of concrete, metal, plastic, bricks and asphalt has brought the world to a crossover point where human-made mass – driven mostly by enhanced consumption and urban development – exceeds the overall living biomass on Earth.</p><p class="css-38z03z">On average, every person in the world is responsible for the creation of human-made matter equal to more than their bodyweight each week, the paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-3010-5" data-link-name="in body link">published in Nature</a> says.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The research found that the stamp of humanity has been increasing in size rapidly since the beginning of the 20th century, doubling every 20 years.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The researchers support a proposal to name the current epoch as Anthropocene, reflecting the abrupt and considerable impact of human activity.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Ron Milo, of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, and colleagues examined changes in global biomass and human-made mass from 1900 to the present day. They calculated dry weight estimates, excluding water. Anthropogenic mass is defined as the mass embedded in inanimate solid objects made by humans and does not include waste.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The dominant categories in the analysis were human-made mass in the form of buildings and infrastructure, composed of concrete, aggregates, bricks and asphalt. As for global biomass, the majority is accounted for by plants and shrubs.</p><p class="css-38z03z">They found that at the beginning of the 20th century, the mass of human-produced objects was equal to about 3% of the world’s total biomass. But in 2020, human-made mass has reached about 1.1 teratonnes, exceeding overall global biomass.</p><p class="css-38z03z">As human-made mass has increased, so too has the impact on plant biomass. “Since the first agricultural revolution, humanity has roughly halved the mass of plants,” the authors write. “While modern agriculture utilises an increasing land area for growing crops, the total mass of domesticated crops is vastly outweighed by the loss of plant mass resulting from deforestation, forest management and other land-use changes. These trends in global biomass have affected the carbon cycle and human health.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">Over the decades there are rises and dips in human impact, including sharp increases after the switch in the 1950s from bricks to concrete and the use of asphalt for pavements in the 1960s.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“Shifts in total anthropogenic mass are tied to global events such as world wars and major economic crises,” the paper says. Most notably, there are continuous increases in human-made mass of more than 5% per year from the period immediately following the second world war, which became known as the “great acceleration” and was characterised by enhanced consumption and urban development.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Conversely, during times of downturn the weight of the human footprint decreases. There are key dips seen during the Great Depression and the 1979 oil crash.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“The face of Earth in the 21st century is affected in an unprecedented manner by the activities of humanity and the production and accumulation of human-made objects,” the researchers say.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Since 1900 overall biomass has decreased slightly, whereas human-made mass has increased rapidly to a production rate of more than 30 gigatonnes (30,000,000,000 tonnes) per year. If human production continues at this rate, the weight of our impact will exceed 3 teratonnes by 2040.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“This study joins recent efforts to quantify and evaluate the scale and impact of human activities on our planet,” the paper says. “The impacts of these activities have been so abrupt and considerable that it has been proposed that the current geological epoch be renamed the Anthropocene. Our study rigorously and quantitatively substantiates this proposal.”</p><br>

<p>Asian honey bees paste pellets of animal poo on to their nests to repel attacks by giant killer hornets, scientists have revealed.</p><p>The attacks can involve dozens of the heavily armoured hornets and lead to the “mass slaughter” of thousands of bees, the researchers said, after which the hornets carry off the bee larvae to feed their own offspring. But in a continuing evolutionary arms race, the bees have developed defence mechanisms such as hissing at them or mobbing the hornets to suffocate them.</p><p>However, the newly discovered strategy using faeces shocked the scientists because bees are famously hygienic in order to prevent disease in their hives. The team do not yet know exactly why the poo pellets are particularly repulsive.</p><p>The giant hornets studied by the team are a very close relative of the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/murder-hornet-nest-queens-washington" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">murder hornets</a>” that have alarmed beekeepers in the US and Canada over the past year, while other giant hornets are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asian-hornet-uk-sightings" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">regularly found and destroyed in the UK</a>. Bees in Europe and North America have not evolved the defences, making them “sitting ducks”, the scientists said.</p><p>Prof Heather Mattila at Wellesley College in the US, who led the study, said: “I was shocked [by the use of faeces] because bees have such a good reputation for being clean. They have hot, wet, permanent homes that are a great place for disease to grow and are filled with babies and food.”</p><p>She said the arrival of giant hornets in North America in 2019 was very concerning. “The first time I heard about it, I was so worried I couldn’t sleep. I thought, ‘These bees are going to get massacred.’ They just don’t have the exposure to these hornet species and, as a result, they are sitting ducks.”</p><p>Matt Shardlow, at Buglife, said the bees’ use of faecal pellets was “an amazingly sophisticated defence mechanism” showing that surviving predation is a complex task. He said there was no guarantee that native bees could develop defences to hornets, even over thousands of years: “It is a clear illustration of why we must try to slow the spate of invasive species we are instigating.”</p><p>The research, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242668" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">published in the journal Plos One</a>, began when Prof Gard Otis, at the University of Guelph, Canada, and one of the study team asked a beekeeper in Vietnam what the spots around the hive entrances were. The reply: buffalo dung.</p><p>The team found that the bees also collected faeces from livestock. “We spent a lot of time hanging out in nearby farms. I sat with pigs and a chicken coop and finally it paid off.” They then conducted experiments that showed the bees only spotted their hives after visits from predatory hornets.</p><p>They found these hornets spent less than half the time at nest entrances with dung spotting, compared with clean hives, and 94% less time trying to chew their way in. A final experiment discovered that hives daubed with the secretions that giant hornets use to flag nests for attack were quickly plastered with poo.</p><p>After contacting other bee experts, the researchers learned that the spotting behaviour is widespread throughout Vietnam and reported in China, Thailand, Bhutan, and Nepal. Some species of stingless bee were known to collect animal faeces and incorporate it into their nests, but this was the first report for honey bees.</p><p>Why the dung repels the hornets is as yet unknown, but other insects such as the caterpillar of the tobacco hornworm moth are known to cover themselves in poo to deter predators. The researchers said the deterrence may simply be because it is faeces, and seen as unclean, or it may be due to substances present in the animals’ food. Another possibility is that the poo pellets are olfactory camouflage for the nest, masking the scents the hornets use to mark target nests.</p><p>Mattila said the discovery may also be the first clear example of honey bee tool use. “It gets down to semantics, but the fact that these bees are collecting something from the environment, holding it, manipulating it and changing the character of the thing that they’re applying it to, makes it a tool by virtually every definition.”</p><p>During the research, the honey bees were not the only ones at risk from the hornets, which pack about seven times as much venom in a single sting as a honeybee. “I got stung by one and it was the most excruciating sting in my life,” said Otis.</p><br>

<p>The unprecedented fires aren’t just caused by the climate crisis. Land use –especially real estate and animal husbandry – have a lot to answer for</p><p class="css-vdb1rb">Last modified on Tue 8 Dec 2020 20.04 GMT</p><p class="css-38z03z"><span class="css-1r9pv9q"><span class="css-1ac5g5w">A</span></span><span class="css-38z03z"> good, natural fire can be a cleansing force. Yet, the recent and ongoing catastrophic fires around the world – including in Brazil, the US, Sweden, Russia and Australia – are not moments of a healthy fire cycle but conflagrations of a dying biosphere.</span></p><p class="css-38z03z">Terrible as they are, the fires in the western American states are only middling on a global scale. As of early November, 8.6m acres (3.5m hectares) had burned nationally, with half of that total in California. This year has been the worst fire season on record for Colorado and California, the latter enduring five of its six largest fires since colonization. But the American catastrophe pales in comparison to Australia’s wildfires last summer, which incinerated an eye-watering 46m acres. More than a fifth of the country’s forests were destroyed in a single year. Siberia’s fires in 2020 were even bigger – 47m acres. A tenth of South America’s largest wetland, the Pantanal, went up in smoke this year – some 6m acres – coupled with the Amazon losing 8.5m acres. That latter figure is only half the size of last year’s fiery nightmare.</p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="css-38z03z">These unnatural wildfires may offer few ecological benefits, but they clear out the deadwood clogging up the public sphere. It is commonly understood that the recent fires are linked to climate change, but that is only half right. “Land-use change” is a cause of similar importance, yet it takes up little space in our public sphere. While the center and left may congratulate themselves that they “get” climate change unlike the pig-headed right, no political faction has mobilized around this second great disaster.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The recent fires each have local idiosyncrasies, such as the Brazilian government’s murderous attack on indigenous people or California’s trillion-dollar real estate industry, but a global perspective helps one see why things became awful everywhere. Climate change can reduce precipitation and warm the air, a combination that dries out soils and trees in some ecosystems like California, turning forests into kindling awaiting a spark. Such processes are aggravated by the jump in deforestation globally since the 1990s. The end of history seems to have heralded the end of forests too. For example, most clearcutting of the Amazon has happened since 1990, with almost all of the land replaced with pasture for cattle. As the world-market finally emerged in the 1990s – an event predicted nearly a century and a half before by Karl Marx in 1848 – capitalism swiftly remade heaven and Earth through carbon emissions and land-use change of unprecedented scope.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Centrists seem to believe that the fires will convince conservatives that climate change is real. This has not happened. During a press conference on the fires in September, Donald Trump claimed that “it’ll start getting cooler”. After the Arctic tundra caught fire for the first time in 2018, the fascist Sweden Democrats suggested cutting taxes on gasoline. Conservatives in Australia and Brazil blamed the fires on non-existent eco-terrorists. Centrists don’t realize that the solution is not more “facts” but a rebalancing in social forces.</p><p class="css-38z03z">How then does the left understand this new age of fire? Its foremost theorist on this issue is the environmental historian Mike Davis. A native Californian, he is famous for his 1997 polemic The Case for Letting Malibu Burn, in which he attacked the government for turning a blind eye towards Los Angeles slumlords flouting fire regulations while frittering away millions to defend mansions in Malibu – an ecosystem that inevitably burns. Two decades later in 2019, he contrasted the ashes of Paradise, an exurban working-class town of the elderly and disabled, to the wealthy enclave of Calabasas, where private firefighters are becoming a “status symbol for hill-dwelling celebrities”. Davis’s critique of California’s insane housing market has only become more acute over time. Since 2000, <em>half </em>of all new residential construction in California has taken place in the exurbs; rising prices have forced more and more people to live surrounded by bone-dry forest with few evacuation routes.</p><p class="css-38z03z">As arsonist ranchers in Brazil make clear, animal husbandry is part of the problem too. Ranching is the main driver of deforestation in Australia. Deforestation not only leaves plenty of combustible material about, but it also dries out the remaining trees because forests create their own microclimate by releasing water vapor. Even the green giant of the Amazon might shrink to the point where it cannot sustain its cloud cover and degenerate into a savanna.</p><p class="css-38z03z">California too falls under “livestock’s long shadow”. Davis and other experts emphasize how “cheatgrass”, a highly invasive and combustible plant, aggravates wildfires. In his telling, cheatgrass is an effect without a cause, but even the US Department of Agriculture concedes the botanical scourge spreads thanks to overgrazing. And there is plenty of overgrazing in California. It is not Wisconsin but the Golden State that is “America’s dairyland”, a position it holds because of the willingness to dedicate 60% of the vast state to rangeland. Through thirsty fodder crops like alfalfa, the dairy industry guzzles more water than 40 million Californians.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a raft of measures as a response to the fires in California that deals with both the earthy and aerial aspects of the environmental crisis: a ban on new petrol-fuelled cars by 2035 and the mandate to preserve 30% of California’s land and coastal waters by 2030. These measures complement the state’s existing commitment to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% relative to its 1990 level by 2030. While these goals are laudable, Newsom pretends that they will not conflict with the livestock industry’s interests. Yet, even big dairy’s in-house scientists scoff at the “cowpie in the sky” goal of cutting emissions by 40%.</p><p class="css-38z03z">While California has met its target of reducing 2020 emissions to 1990 levels, mainly through expanding its renewable energy infrastructure, full decarbonization will require painful political confrontation. There are lots of low-hanging fruit left, but they won’t get us all the way to the IPCC 1.5-degree goal. As long as the power stays on, everyone can get behind solar panels and wind turbines. But limiting climate change to 1.5C and averting mass extinction – by shrinking the livestock industry and making what even the apolitical IPCC calls “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” – make the conflict that centrists like Newsom seek to avoid all but inevitable.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The solution to the wildfire problem is clear enough, and socialist critics like Davis are on the right track to criticize the cult of home ownership. Centrists should be given credit for pushing forward a renewable-energy transition. Yet, the environmental crisis cannot be fully overcome without a clear-eyed look at the land-use problem – and serious consideration over whether animal husbandry is worth its outsized environmental costs.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Californians like to pride themselves that the future happens there first. Indeed, it isn’t too late to remake heaven and Earth once more, decarbonizing the sky and rewilding the land to create a more biodiverse and environmentally stable society. Without its bloated livestock industry, California could vanquish cheatgrass, sequester tons of carbon in healthier ecosystems, and liberate dammed rivers. In this rewilded ecosystem, beavers – yes, California has beavers – could reclaim their old territory, acting once again as nature’s humble engineers. Wetlands, many sustained by beaver dams, act as a fire break and refuge for forest creatures during a blaze. (Indeed, mega-fires may be sparking local extinction events). Many of these lessons apply to other fire-racked regions of the world, from the Amazon to Australia. But first, there needs to be a political coalition that recognizes what fuels these fires in the first place.</p><p>Drew Pendergrass is a PhD student in Environmental Engineering at Harvard University.

<p>Chancellor urged to prioritise plans to realign spending with cuts to carbon emissions </p><p class="css-vdb1rb">Last modified on Fri 3 Jul 2020 08.01 BST</p><p class="css-38z03z">The chancellor of the exchequer must lay out urgent plans to realign government spending with the target to cut carbon emissions to net zero, or risk missing the target and fuelling high carbon emissions for years to come, Labour has urged.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The warning comes as the Treasury prepares <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/30/boris-johnson-new-deal-tuc-cbi" data-link-name="in body link">key policy announcements</a> on the UK’s recovery from the coronavirus recession, which Rishi Sunak is expected to set out in his spending review next week.</p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="css-38z03z">Environmental campaigners are pinning their hopes on the chancellor proving more receptive to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/23/uk-public-supports-green-recovery-from-coronavirus-crisis" data-link-name="in body link">green recovery</a> than the prime minister, after Boris Johnson set out his vision for a<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/30/environmental-experts-dismayed-by-details-of-johnsons-new-deal" data-link-name="in body link"> “new deal” this week</a> in which the climate crisis merited barely a mention, but “newt counting” was singled out as “a drag on productivity”.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Wes Streeting, Labour’s shadow exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said a key test for Sunak would be the Treasury’s Green Book, a set of guidelines that governs how ministers and civil servants appraise and evaluate policy, projects and programmes.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Streeting wants to see sweeping reforms. “The Treasury really is crucial [and] should step up,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “A reform of the Green Book should have net zero writ large, so that the civil servants and ministers making appraisals of policy can take account of whether those policies help or hinder reaching net zero.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">The Green Book matters because in the past many proposed green policies, such as incentives for low-carbon energy, or infrastructure building, have fallen foul of the Treasury’s criteria on value for money. But if the net zero target, enshrined in law last year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/25/road-to-net-zero-what-the-committee-on-climate-change-recommends" data-link-name="in body link">is to be reached then it must also be made a key criterion for the Treasury.</a></p><p class="css-38z03z">“They are squandering this opportunity,” said Streeting. “The government approach to climate change reeks of complacency. But the Committee on Climate Change has warned that they’re not going far enough, fast enough. There is no plan for net zero.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">Streeting also called for the chancellor to put in place a programme of energy efficiency improvements for Britain’s homes: the draughtiest in Europe and a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions. On electric vehicles, he said the government needed to provide more incentives to car-owners.</p><p class="css-38z03z">He urged the chancellor to fund a new green infrastructure bank, that would provide public money and attract private sector investment for big projects such as improving the railways and public transport. The long-awaited national infrastructure strategy has been put off until this autumn, which will also delay net zero plans, he warned.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“There is no shortage of ideas and recommendations [on how to ensure the economic recovery is in line with the net zero target] but what’s missing is leadership and action,” Streeting said.</p><p class="css-38z03z">If the government were to bring forward plans for a green recovery, Labour would support them, he pledged. “We worked constructively with the government on the coronavirus crisis,” he pointed out. “Net zero is a cross-party issue.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">The Liberal Democrats are also pushing for the government to ensure its spending plans lead to a green recovery, after Johnson’s “new deal” announcement held little new policy on cutting emissions. The party is hoping for wider backing for a new draft bill that would require the secretary of state to help the 2.6m households in England living in fuel poverty, making fuel bills cheaper and reducing the UK’s carbon footprint.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The private member’s bill would require the government to ensure all fuel-poor households were brought up to energy performance band C by 2030 and all other households to the same band by 2035.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The Liberal Democrat peer and former MP for Bath, Don Foster, told the Guardian that the government had promised such action on fuel poverty in 2017 but had failed to follow through. “The prime minister has promised a green recovery to help rescue our economy from the coronavirus crisis – however, we are yet to see any concrete action,” he said. “If this government is determined to prove their green recovery is more than just empty promises, they need to be more ambitious. Backing this bill would be a welcome start.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">A Treasury spokesperson said: “The Green Book requires that environmental impacts – including the impact on our net zero target – are considered in all government investment decisions. We remain committed to tackling climate change and as our economy reopens following from the coronavirus outbreak we will seeks to drive clean, sustainable growth across all regions. This includes continuing the review of the Green Book and our processes for allocating funding.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">Next week, after the chancellor’s announcement, the UK will be one of the leading participants in a key summit on the green recovery, to be held by the International Energy Agency with the US, China, India, Brazil and the EU participating. The UK will be in the spotlight as host of the next UN climate summit, Cop26, postponed to next year.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Streeting said: “Cop26 is the last chance saloon. The UK has a huge responsibility to the rest of the world. But we are clearly behind on Cop26. We need to do more.”</p><br>

<p>Local wildlife trust says work has devastated Herefordshire river but landowner says EA asked him to do it </p><p class="css-vdb1rb">Last modified on Tue 8 Dec 2020 11.54 GMT</p><p class="css-38z03z">Environment agency officials were under pressure on Monday to explain exactly what consent they gave to carry out extensive work on the banks of a protected river in England.</p><p class="css-38z03z"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/04/police-move-in-after-herefordshire-river-bulldozed-and-straightened" data-link-name="in body link">Officials from the EA, Natural England and the Forestry Commission</a> moved in last week to stop the work along the River Lugg outside Kingsland, near Leominster in Herefordshire.</p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="css-38z03z">The officials – along with the police – issued a stop notice to the landowner, John Price, to halt the works, which the local wildlife trust said had devastated the river and would have dire consequences for wildlife and water quality.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The EA said a legal notice requiring the works to stop immediately was served on the landowner by Natural England earlier last week, the Forestry Commission issued a stop letter requiring an end to any further felling work and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment-agency" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Environment Agency</a> requested no further works to be carried out on the river.</p><p class="css-38z03z">But the landowner Price, a potato and cattle farmer, has insisted that he was asked to do the work by the EA to try to tackle flooding in the area.</p><p class="css-38z03z">On Monday the local parish council told the Guardian it had been in discussion with the EA since July about tackling the flooding in the area. EA officials had attended parish council meetings and walked the site in September.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The EA wrote a short report seen by the Guardian. It said: “We have identified that some tree works are required on the left hand bank directly upstream of the bridge (see picture 0141) which we will again look to secure funding for and if successful make the land owner aware of our intentions.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“In addition the left hand bank directly upstream of the bridge could do some reprofiling due to bank slumping probably as a result of cattle poaching (see picture 0132) to ease conveyance as it is currently partially obstructing the 3rd arch of the bridge and will look to the land owner to carry out these works.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">The EA said on Monday it was continuing to investigate the damage to a river which is protected as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), and a special area of conservation (SAC). As such no work should be carried out without permission from the EA.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Minutes of parish council meetings confirm that the EA was in discussions with the council about flooding and what work was required to alleviate it.</p><p class="css-38z03z"><a href="https://kingsland-pc.gov.uk/parish-council-minutes/minutes-2020/" data-link-name="in body link">Minutes of Kingsland parish council meetings from July, September and October</a> of this year contain items about the “maintenance of the Lugg”.</p><p class="css-38z03z">In minutes of a meeting in July concerns were expressed about the risk of river flooding and reference made to discussions with the EA on maintenance of the Lugg.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The minutes detail verbal discussions with the EA. “The levels reached during the floods earlier this year were the highest since 1976. Due to the Covid-19 situation, the riverbank has not been walked since the floods, however this is due to be done soon.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“Dredging can be done where there is a need, but need to keep in mind the dynamic nature of the river which moves the bed levels anyway (diverse nature of river flow).”</p><p class="css-38z03z">In October reference was made to the site visit in September with an EA official. “Cllr Rowsell reported on “a very useful” walkabout with the Environment Agency. Mr W Best, Environment Agency informed the meeting that riparian owners are responsible for maintenance but accepted that this may be beyond their capability at times and provided a helpline number.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">A spokesperson for the parish council said on Monday they were not aware whether the EA had given the landowner official permission to carry out the works.</p><p class="css-38z03z">He said: “We would not be told whether a permit had been issued for the works. The parish council supports work to improve the Lugg to help with flood alleviation measures. Environment Agency officials have been present in parish council meetings to discuss flood alleviation measures.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">Price, of Hay Farm, told the Daily Telegraph, he had acted with permission.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“I have watched this river all my life, and no one knows this river better than myself,” he said.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“I have always looked after the river. I was asked to stop the erosion because I’m the landowner so I’m responsible for the river.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">He said he had not uprooted any trees, but had only cleared those that had come down in floods.</p><p class="css-38z03z">He said flooding in the area had been getting worse over the last 10 years, and that he had the support of the village and parish council in doing the work.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The Environment Agency was asked for a comment. It had not been provided at the time of publication.</p><p class="css-38z03z"><br></p><br>

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he water shines blue and gold in the evening light. Across the fields, a herd of dark fallow deer runs out of the trees and across the brooks. One by one, they slow to a stop and queue, waiting as the animal in front of them disappears into a ditch, reappears as it climbs out, and then runs to catch up with the others.</p><p>I count 79 deer, but see only one adult stag, its tall antlers glinting as it turns to watch the stragglers. A female <a href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/marsh-harrier/" title="" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">marsh harrier</a>, brown with a cream head, flaps over them, probably heading to roost. The sun will soon drop below the shadows of the South Downs, so I turn and head down the steep flood bank and back across the marsh.</p><p>Noisy flocks of <a href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/starling/" title="" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">starlings</a> descend on the tall trees by the river. They crowd on to the branches and chatter in a loud atonal chorus. More join them and the cacophony builds. Then they begin to soar into the air, 40 or more at a time, forming clouds of black dots – swerving in fluid, changing shapes, first one way, then back, moving across the brooks until they rise above a patch of reedbed and drop down into it.</p><p>As the birds adjust their flickering wings to land, the sunlight leaks through their turning feathers, making the wings shimmer briefly, like flashing lights, before they disappear. I watch several small groups perform the same ritual as they settle down for the night.

<p>Move to help finance climate ambitions follows calls from campaigners and economists </p><p class="css-vdb1rb">Last modified on Wed 15 Jul 2020 07.24 BST</p><p class="css-38z03z">The UK government is poised to reveal plans for a new state-backed green bank to help finance Britain’s climate ambitions, three years after ministers agreed to sell the UK’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/12/green-investment-bank-sold-too-cheaply-watchdog-says" data-link-name="in body link">Green Investment Bank</a>.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Kwasi Kwarteng, the energy minister, said that he expects the government to set out how it plans to create a successor to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-investment-bank" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Green Investment Bank</a> “in the not-too-distant future”.</p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="css-38z03z">The move to rebuild a new green lender comes amid growing calls from climate campaigners, economists and academics to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/02/invest-in-the-green-economy-and-well-recover-from-the-covid-19-crisis" data-link-name="in body link">invest in green infrastructure</a> to help revive the UK’s struggling economy and help meet its climate targets.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The government sold the UK’s original Green Investment Bank to Australian bank Macquarie in 2017, only five years after it was formed, in a controversial deal dubbed “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/14/green-investment-bank-sell-off-mps-macquarie" data-link-name="in body link">deeply regrettable</a>” and “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/20/green-investment-bank-sell-off-dubbed-a-disaster-by-critics" data-link-name="in body link">politically dubious</a>” by critics of the sale.</p><p class="css-38z03z">At a digital event hosted by climate campaign group UK100 on Monday, the minister said it is “no secret” that there is “an ongoing debate within government about how we can in effect create the Green Investment Bank 2.0”.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“I fully expect there may well be announcements in that regard in the not-too-distant future,” Kwarteng added.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The minister said that the UK’s commitment to build a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050" data-link-name="in body link">net zero carbon</a>” economy within 30 years, and the “huge amount of investment” needed to reach this goal, “suggests that there may well be scope” for a new green development bank.</p><p class="css-38z03z">He added that his personal view favoured a bank that focuses on the consumer and suggested that a bank similar to Germany’s state-owned development bank KfW, which was set up in the wake of the second world war to invest in infrastructure, could facilitate this.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Polly Billington, the director of <a href="https://www.uk100.org/" data-link-name="in body link">UK100</a>, said business and banks should take on a much bigger role in “building back better”.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“Green investment will create thousands of jobs, tackle climate change and secure the recovery. Our research with Siemens found that investing £5bn in renewable energy could unlock £100bn of private capital. We look forward to working with the government to make this happen,” she said.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Researchers at the Grantham Institute, part of the London School of Economics (LSE), have called for ministers to plough £20bn in paid cash towards a new national investment bank to establish a pipeline of clean infrastructure projects including carbon capture and hydrogen.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The new report, commissioned by the Aldersgate Group, proposed the state-backed bank alongside a string of near-term public investments and long-term, low-carbon strategies.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The recommendations include funding for energy efficiency upgrades, tree planting and wetland restoration to boost Britain’s green recovery and help create new jobs and training opportunities.</p><p class="css-38z03z">The report’s four-prong approach also set out a “low carbon skills” strategy to level-up workers who might be left underemployed or unemployed following the pandemic, and a long-term framework for low-carbon investment using a rising carbon market price to incentivise private investments.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Dimitri Zenghelis, a senior visiting fellow at the LSE and the co-author of the report, said: “The government has made a good start with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/08/not-what-a-green-recovery-looks-like-rishi-sunaks-plan-gets-mixed-response" data-link-name="in body link">summer statement</a> and early stimulus measures will help shore up a more resilient economy over the next two years. But the government must now turn its rhetoric on green recovery into predictable and credible commitments to build a sustainable economy over next decade and beyond.”</p><br>

<p>If the government plots a green recovery from coronavirus, the benefits are endless. If it doesn’t, we’re screwed<br></p><p class="css-vdb1rb">Last modified on Wed 1 Jul 2020 17.16 BST</p><p class="css-38z03z"><span class="css-1r9pv9q"><span class="css-1ac5g5w">T</span></span><span class="css-38z03z">rillions of dollars will be invested by governments in reviving their economies over the next two or three years. If those dollars are well spent, ensuringlow-carbon, nature-restoring prosperity, we have a real chance of avoiding runaway climate change and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/ecosystems-size-of-amazon-rainforest-can-collapse-within-decades" data-link-name="in body link">ecosystem collapse</a>. If they’re spent on taking us back to pre-coronavirus days, we’re screwed. The climate’s screwed. The planet’s screwed. And all future generations are screwed. It’s as simple – and as binary – as that.</span></p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="css-38z03z">This year was meant to be the year of major breakthroughs in addressing the <a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/2020-crunch-year-biodiversity-and-climate-emergencies" data-link-name="in body link">climate emergency</a><a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/2020-crunch-year-biodiversity-and-climate-emergencies" data-link-name="in body link"> and the biodiversity crisis</a>. It will be neither. It will live in the minds of most people as the Year of Covid-19. And rightly so. But those twin emergencies of climate and collapsing ecosystems haven’t gone away while we’ve been straining humankind’s every sinew to mitigate the impacts of the deadliest public health threat in 100 years.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Yet what made the climate emergency and the biodiversity crisis so urgent before Covid-19 guarantees that they will be even more daunting and even more disruptive at the end of this traumatic year – with a whole 12 months lost in terms of political engagement and leadership.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Ignore all the over-excited coverage there will no doubt be at the end of this year celebrating a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/lockdowns-trigger-dramatic-fall-global-carbon-emissions" data-link-name="in body link">reduction in greenhouse gas emissions</a> of up to 10%, towns and cities temporarily purged of the horror of toxic air quality (killing far more people, by the way, every year, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/air-pollution-smoking-deaths-compare-a8818851.html" data-link-name="in body link">than Covid-19 will)</a>, and nature back in our lives through the magic of birdsong and wild creatures returning to our denatured urban landscapes. Look on all that as a short-lived respite, a beautiful but evanescent manifestation of how things could be, for citizens the world over. All those silver linings will rapidly disappear unless we start doing things very differently.</p><p class="css-38z03z">A mighty choir of voices (from <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2020/05/22/prince-charles-launch-great-reset-project-rebuild-planet-wake/" data-link-name="in body link">Prince Charles</a> and <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/resources/green-recovery-manifesto/" data-link-name="in body link">Greenpeace</a> to <a href="https://www.corporateleadersgroup.com/reports-evidence-and-insights/news-items/leading-businesses-urge-uk-government-to-deliver-resilient-recovery-plan" data-link-name="in body link">countless multinationals</a> and <a href="https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/publications/wpapers/workingpaper20-02.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">academics</a>) are now singing from the rooftops to remind our politicians that we have a glorious opportunity to bring forward lasting improvements that would have been unimaginable even six months ago. Their mandate now is crystal clear: restore purchasing power; create new jobs; prioritise the least well-off – and do all of that in ways that simultaneously make it possible for us to deliver climate stability and a thriving planet.</p><p class="css-38z03z">So is there any indication that the UK government is thinking in those terms? The short answer is “possibly”. Beyond the <a href="https://www.businessgreen.com/news/4015783/boris-johnson-owe-future-generations-build" data-link-name="in body link">standard waffle from the prime minister</a> (“We owe it to future generations to ‘build back better’ and base our recovery on solid foundations, including a fairer, greener and more resilient global economy”), there have been much stronger declarations of intent from both the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury, with specific talk of a <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-wants-green-new-jobs-for-laid-off-workers-8520zlsnx" data-link-name="in body link">“green industrial revolution”</a> to create tens of thousands of new jobs.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Even the Department for Transport has been getting in on the act, announcing plans for<a href="https://www.businessgreen.com/news/4015238/government-plots-500-rapid-ev-chargers-england-2030" data-link-name="in body link"> 2,500 electric charging points</a> along motorways and A-roads by 2030, as well as a £250m <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/2-billion-package-to-create-new-era-for-cycling-and-walking" data-link-name="in body link">active travel fund</a> to support the development of pop-up bike lanes, wider pavements and cycle- and bus-only corridors – a down-payment, apparently, on a much bigger programme under consideration.</p><p class="css-38z03z">But all this is very small beer indeed compared with the plans of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to spend up to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/chancellor-announces-27bn-for-roadbuilding-in-budget" data-link-name="in body link">£27bn over the next five years</a> to expand Britain’s road network – locking us into decades of carbon-intensive car dependency at precisely the time when every company in the country is developing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/08/work-after-coronavirus-how-will-it-change-when-the-lockdown-is-over" data-link-name="in body link">post-coronavirus work</a> and travel planning, specifically to reduce car use and commuting, doubling down on more flexible, tech-enabled ways of working.</p><p class="css-38z03z">So just flip it, Rishi! Transport is the UK’s <a href="https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2020/02/uk-emissions-fall-as-coal-power-shut-off-date-brought-forward/" data-link-name="in body link">biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Hang on to that scale of ambition by making the £27bn available to our cities and towns to invest in cycle lanes, better pedestrian facilities and improved public transport – as cities such as <a href="https://news.bristol.gov.uk/news/pandemic-accelerates-revamp-of-bristols-transport-network" data-link-name="in body link">Bristol </a>and <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayors-bold-plan-will-overhaul-capitals-streets" data-link-name="in body link">London</a> are already starting to do. This will deliver jobs at the local level (especially in many of our northern cities, which one assumes Boris Johnson hasn’t yet entirely forgotten about), cleaner air and improved health (reducing the burden on the NHS) and potentially massive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 10 years. </p><p class="css-38z03z">Similar, massive benefits are available if the government chooses to invest in a nationwide housing retrofit programme, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Deal#:~:text=The%20Green%20Deal%20was%20a,the%20cost%20of%20the%20work" data-link-name="in body link">a pre-existing commitment</a> that has come and gone on several occasions, simply because no previous government ever put its money where its cynically gabby mouth was. As the <a href="https://greennewdealgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Green-New-Deal-5th-Anniversary.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">Green New Deal group has shown</a>, as well as the government’s own <a href="https://www.nic.org.uk/news/new-report-underlines-need-to-tackle-carbon-emissions-from-homes/" data-link-name="in body link">Infrastructure Commission</a>, an ambitious retrofit programme means jobs in every constituency (many of them available to young people staring out on a blighted, jobless post-coronavirus world), a huge uptake in construction skills and trades, a rapid reduction in the kind of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/27/dying-cold-europe-fuel-poverty-energy-spending" data-link-name="in body link">fuel poverty</a> that has blighted the lives of tens of millions of people (simultaneously costing the NHS billions every year), with significant reductions in greenhouse gas emission by the end of the decade. </p><p class="css-38z03z">Once the Treasury opens its mind to the potential of a far-reaching Green New Deal, we should also be borrowing unashamedly from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/roosevelts-new-deal" data-link-name="in body link">President Roosevelt’s original New Deal</a> back in the 1930s by creating a 21st-century equivalent of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps" data-link-name="in body link">Conservation Corps </a>to help restore this nation’s desperately degraded environment. It’s only six months since the major political parties were trying to out-green each other by committing to massive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/16/liberal-democrats-pledge-to-plant-60m-trees-a-year" data-link-name="in body link">tree-planting programmes</a> in their election manifestos. Since then, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has pretty much sat on its hands.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Nothing is ever quite as “shovel-ready” as advocates would have us believe, but local transport solutions, housing retrofits and nature-climate solutions could all be brought forward, at speed and at scale, in ways that would be hugely popular with citizens across the country. There is now not one good reason why this government shouldn’t soon be announcing one of the most ambitious rescue packages anywhere in the world.</p><p class="css-38z03z">• Jonathon Porritt is an environmentalist and author.

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">N</span></span>o one who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">in the hall that winter evening in a gloomy conference centre</a> on the outskirts of the French capital will ever forget it. Tension had been building throughout the afternoon, as after two weeks of fraught talks the expected resolution was delayed and then delayed yet again. Rumours swirled – had the French got it wrong? Was another climate failure approaching, the latest botched attempt at solving the world’s global heating crisis?</p><p>Finally, as the mood in the hall was growing twitchy, the UN security guards cleared the platform and the top officials of the landmark Paris climate talks took to the podium. For two weeks, 196 countries had huddled in countless meetings, wrangling over dense pages of text, scrutinising every semicolon. And they had finally reached agreement. Laurent Fabius, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2015/dec/12/the-world-is-counting-on-paris-climate-talks-says-fabius-video" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">the French foreign minister in charge of the gruelling talks</a>, looking exhausted but delighted, reached for his gavel and brought it down with a resounding crack. The Paris agreement was approved at last.</p><p>Nicholas Stern, the climate economist, found himself hugging <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/05/china-due-contribution-emissions-cuts" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">Xia Zhenhua</a>, the normally reserved Chinese minister, while whoops and shouts echoed round the hall. “I felt that the Paris agreement was the moment when the world decided it really had to manage climate change in a serious way,” he said. “We were all in it together, that’s what people realised.”</p><p>At Paris, for the first time rich and poor countries joined together in a legally binding treaty pledging to hold global heating to heating well below 2C, the scientifically-advised limit of safety, with an aspiration not to breach <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">1.5C above pre-industrial levels</a>. Those two weeks of tense talks in the French capital were the climax of 25 years of tortuous negotiations on the climate, since governments were warned of the dangers of climate chaos in 1990. The failure, discord and recriminations of those decades were left behind as delegates from 196 countries hugged, wept and cheered in Paris.</p><p>Todd Stern, climate envoy to President Barack Obama, recalls: “My team and I had been working toward this for seven years … and the story of climate negotiations had so often been one of disappointment. And yet here we were and we knew that we had – all together – done a really big thing. A very special moment. An unforgettable one.”</p><p>The accord itself has proved remarkably resilient. Bringing together 196 nations in 2015 was not easy – even as Fabius brought down the gavel on the agreement, there was a little chicanery as Nicaragua had planned to object to the required consensus, but was ignored. Yet that consensus has remained robust. When the US – the world’s biggest economy and second biggest emitter – began the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/01/the-us-tried-to-derail-climate-action-before-and-it-ended-in-humiliating-defeat" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">process of withdrawal from Paris, under President Donald Trump in 2017</a>, a disaster might have been expected. The Kyoto 1997 protocol fell apart after the US signed but failed to ratify the agreement, leaving climate negotiations in limbo for a decade.</p><p>If Trump was hoping to wreck Paris, he was disappointed: the rest of the world shrugged and carried on. There was no exodus of other countries, although some did <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/30/how-trump-emboldening-other-countries-bad-behavior-climate-crisis" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">pursue more aggressive tactics at the annual UN talks</a>. The key axis of China and the EU remained intact, deliberately underlined by China’s President Xi Jinping when he chose to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/22/china-pledges-to-reach-carbon-neutrality-before-2060" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">surprise the world with a net zero emissions target at the UN general assembly in September</a>, just as the UN election race was hotting up.</p><p>Remy Rioux, one of the French government team who led the talks, now chief executive of the French Development Agency, said: “The Paris agreement has proven to be inclusive and at scale, with the participation of countries representing 97% of global emissions, as well as that of non-state actors such as businesses, local government and financial institutions – and very resilient, precisely because it is inclusive. The Paris agreement is a powerful signal of hope in the face of the climate emergency.”</p><p>On some measures, Paris could be judged a failure. Emissions in 2015 were about 50 bn tonnes. By 2019, they had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/26/united-nations-global-effort-cut-emissions-stop-climate-chaos-2030" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">risen to about 55bn tonnes</a>, according to the UN Environment Programme (Unep). Carbon output fell dramatically, by about 17% overall and far more in some regions, in this spring’s coronavirus lockdowns, but the plunge also revealed an uncomfortable truth: even when transport, industry and commerce grind to a halt, the majority of emissions remain intact. Far greater systemic change is needed, particularly in energy generation around the world, to meet the Paris goals.</p><p>Ban Ki-moon, former UN secretary-general, told the Guardian: “We have lost a lot of time. Five years after the agreement in Paris was adopted with huge expectations and commitment by world leaders, we have not done enough.”</p><p>What’s more, we are still digging up and burning fossil fuels at a frantic rate. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/02/world-is-doubling-down-on-fossil-fuels-despite-climate-crisis-un-report" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">Unep reported last week</a> that production of fossil fuels is planned to increase by 2% a year. Meanwhile, we continue to destroy the world’s carbon sinks, by cutting down forests – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/12/deforestation-world-losing-area-forest-size-of-uk-each-year-report-finds" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">the world is still losing an area of forest the size of the UK each year</a>, despite commitments to stop deforestation – as well as drying out peatlands and wetlands, and reducing the ocean’s capacity to absorb carbon from the air.</p><p>Global temperatures have already risen by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/09/global-temperatures-likely-to-hit-at-least-1c-warming-for-next-five-years" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">more than 1C above pre-industrial levels</a>, and the results in extreme weather are evident around the world. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/06/california-wildfires-gigafire-first" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">Wildfires</a> raged across Australia and the US this year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/10/devastating-2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-breaks-all-records" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">more than 30 hurricanes struck</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/17/climate-crisis-alarm-at-record-breaking-heatwave-in-siberia" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">heatwaves blasted Siberia</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/21/arctic-ice-polar-ocean-shrinks-climate-change" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">Arctic ice is melting faster</a>.</p><p>António Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/02/humanity-is-waging-war-on-nature-says-un-secretary-general-antonio-guterres" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">put it in stark terms</a>: “Humanity is waging war on nature.

That massive increase reflects rapid falls in the price of wind turbines and solar panels, which are now competitive or cheaper than fossil fuel generation in many countries, even without subsidy.</p><p>“We never expected to see prices come down so fast,” said Adair Turner, chair of the Energy Transitions Commission and former chief of the UK’s committee on climate change. “We have done better than the most optimistic forecasts.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/over-a-barrel-how-oil-prices-dropped-below-zero#:~:text=US%20oil%20prices%20turned%20negative,the%20fastest%20plunge%20in%20history." data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">Oil prices plunged this spring</a> as coronavirus lockdowns grounded planes and swept cities free of cars, and some analysts predict that the oil business will never recover its old hegemony. Some oil companies, including BP and Shell, now plan to become carbon-neutral.</p><p>Electric vehicles have also improved much faster than expected, reflected in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/06/tesla-investor-defends-electric-carmakers-soaring-share-price" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">stunning share price rise of Tesla</a>. The rise of low-carbon technology has meant that when the Covid-19 crisis struck, leading figures quickly called for a green recovery, and set out plans for ensuring the world “builds back better”.</p><p>Most importantly, the world has coalesced around a new target, based on the Paris goals but not explicit in the accord: net zero emissions. In the last two years, first a trickle and now a flood of countries have come forward with long-term goals to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to a fraction of their current amount, to the point where they are equal to or outweighed by carbon sinks, such as forests.</p><p>Net zero emissions springs from the Paris agreement, though the goal was not made explicit in the treaty’s text. World leaders set the 2C limit, and the aspirational limit of 1.5C, at Paris based on advice from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading body of the world’s climate scientists, which has over years worked out that 2C was the threshold of safety, beyond which the ravages of climate breakdown were likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Even at 1.5C, many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2018/oct/08/ipcc-climate-change-report-urgent-action-fossil-fuels-live" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">low-lying areas could flood from sea level rises and storm surges</a>.</p><p>After Paris, the IPCC was asked to advise further on the emissions cuts needed to stay within those limits. Building on its previous findings, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">world’s climate science authority established in 2018</a> that emissions would have to reach zero around mid-century, and that this could be achieved if emissions were halved in the next decade or so.</p><p>That clear scientific backing helped to establish net zero emissions by 2050 as the standard that must be achieved.</p><p>Net zero emissions means reducing emissions as far as possible, and balancing out whatever remains by increasing carbon sinks, for instance<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/14/re-wild-to-mitigate-the-climate-crisis-urge-leading-scientists" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive"> by growing trees or restoring wetlands and peatlands</a>. Phasing out coal, switching to renewable energy, the more efficient use of energy, and moving to electrified transport will all be key. Nuclear power may also play a role, and some countries such as China and France are investing in a new generation of reactors. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/24/what-is-carbon-capture-usage-and-storage-and-can-it-trap-emissions" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">Carbon capture and storage technology</a>, by which carbon dioxide from large sources as gas-fired power plants or industrial units is captured at source, liquefied and piped into large underground chambers, such as depleted oilfields, is also likely to be needed, in varying amounts according to different analyses.</p><p>Some scientists believe we also need to start to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air. One method of doing this involves <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/08/spreading-rock-dust-on-fields-could-remove-vast-amounts-of-co2-from-air" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">crushing up limestone rocks to spread chalk dust on fields</a>. The limestone absorbs carbon, and the dust improves the soil.</p><p>The UK, EU member states, Norway, Chile and a host of developing nations led the way in adopting net zero targets. In September, China’s president surprised the world by announcing his country would achieve net zero emissions in 2060. Japan and South Korea quickly followed suit. US president-elect Joe Biden has also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/11/us-election-result-boosts-preparations-for-un-climate-summit" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">pledged to adopt a target of net zero emissions by 2050</a>. That puts more than two thirds of the global economy under pledges to reach net zero carbon around mid-century.</p><p>If all of these countries meet their targets, the world will be almost on track to meet the upper limit of the Paris agreement. Climate Action Tracker, which analyses carbon data, has calculated that the current pledges would lead to a temperature rise of 2.1C, bringing the world within “striking distance” of fulfilling the 2015 promise.</p><p>Niklas Hohne of NewClimate Institute, one of the partner organisations behind Climate Action Tracker, said: “Five years on, it’s clear the Paris agreement is driving climate action. Now we’re seeing a wave of countries signing up [to net zero emissions]. Can anyone really afford to miss catching this wave?”</p><p>The key issue, though, is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/09/world-is-running-out-of-time-on-climate-experts-warn" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">whether countries will meet these long-term targets</a>. Making promises for 2050 is one thing, but major policy changes are needed now to shift national economies on to a low-carbon footing. “None of these [net zero] targets will be meaningful without very aggressive action in this decade of the 2020s,” said Todd Stern. “I think there is growing, but not yet broad enough, understanding of that reality.”</p><p>Renewing the shorter term commitments in the Paris agreement will be key. As well as the overarching and legally binding limit of 1.5C or 2C, governments submitted non-binding national plans at Paris to reduce their emissions, or to curb the projected rise in their emissions, in the case of smaller developing countries. The first round of those national plans – called nationally determined contributions – in 2015 were inadequate, however, and would lead to a disastrous 3C of heating.</p><p>Under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">2015 Paris agreement</a>, nations agreed a legally binding target of holding global temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspirational limit of 1.5C.<br></p><p>To stay within those legally binding temperature limits, cuts to greenhouse gases would be key. But the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-paris-climate-summit-and-un-talks" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">long history of climate negotiations since 1990</a> had left a legacy of distrust, and some countries were unwilling to commit to stringent emissions cuts if they feared others were not pulling their weight. So under the accord, governments signed up instead to non-binding national plans – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/03/climate-change-what-is-the-uks-ndc-and-why-is-it-important" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">called nationally determined contributions, or NDCs</a> – on cutting or, in the case of poor countries, curbing the growth of their emissions by about 2030.</p><p>The NDCs that countries presented in 2015 were inadequate to meet the Paris goals, however, and if allowed to stand <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">would result in warming of about 3C</a>, which would cause <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/three-degree-world-cities-drowned-global-warming" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">devastation around the world</a>.</p><p>For that reason, the accord also contains a ratchet mechanism by which every five years countries must submit fresh NDCs that put them closer to the Paris goals. The first deadline for new NDCs is 31 December this year.</p><p>Some countries will meet the deadline:<a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive"> scores of developing countries have already submitted their plans</a>. Bigger economies have been slower to do so, but several are now imminent.</p><p>The UK has announced its NDC, with an emissions cut of 68% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, a marked improvement on its 2015 NDC containing only a 53% cut, though climate experts said a more ambitious target would have been economically feasible.</p><p>The EU is to discuss its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">proposed target of a 55% emissions cut</a> this week. Japan has also produced an NDC, but is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/30/campaigners-attack-japan-shameful-climate-plans-release" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">under pressure to revise it</a>. China is working on its plans, after president Xi Jinping announced in September that Chinese emissions would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/22/china-pledges-to-reach-carbon-neutrality-before-2060" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">peak by 2030</a>.</p><p>The US will miss the deadline, but president-elect Joe Biden has committed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/11/us-election-result-boosts-preparations-for-un-climate-summit" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">rejoining Paris as soon as possible when he takes office</a>, so presenting a new NDC is likely to be a top priority.</p><p>The accord also contained a ratchet mechanism, by which countries must submit new national plans every five years, to bring them in line with the long-term goal, and the first deadline is now looming on 31 December. UN climate talks were supposed to take place this November in Glasgow, but had to be postponed because of the pandemic. The UK will host the Cop26 summit next November instead, and that will be the crucial meeting.</p><p>The signs for that decisive moment are good, according to Laurent Fabius. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/dec/07/us-election-results-2020-joe-biden-defeats-donald-trump-to-win-presidency" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">election of Biden</a> in the US means it will be aligned with the EU and China in pushing for net zero emissions to be fully implemented. “We shall have the conjunction of the planets which made possible the Paris agreement,” Fabius told the Guardian. “Civil society, politics, business all came together for the Paris agreement. We are looking at the same conjunction of the planets now with the US, the EU, China, Japan – if the big ones are going in the right direction, there will be a very strong incentive for all countries to go in the right direction.”</p><p>As host of the Cop26 talks, the UK is redoubling its diplomatic efforts towards next year’s conference. The French government brought all of its diplomatic might to bear on Paris, instructing its ambassadors in every country to make climate change their top priority, and sending out ministers around the globe to drum up support.</p><p>Laurence Tubiana, France’s top diplomat at the talks, said another key innovation was what she termed “360 degree diplomacy”. That means not just working through the standard government channels, with ministerial meetings and chats among officials, but reaching out far beyond, making businesses, local government and city mayors, civil society, academics and citizens part of the talks.</p><p>“That was a very important part of [the success] of Paris,” she said. The UK has taken up a similar stance, with a civil society forum to ensure people’s voices are heard, and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jul/28/un-calls-on-youth-activists-to-advise-on-climate-crisis-and-covid-19-recovery" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">specially convened council of young people advising the UN secretary-general</a>. The UK’s high-level champion, Nigel Topping, is also coordinating a “race to zero” by which companies, and non-state actors such as cities, states and sub-national governments are also committing to reach net zero emissions.</p><p>One massive issue outstanding ahead of Cop26 is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/oct/20/climate-finance-driving-poor-countries-deeper-into-debt-says-oxfam" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">finance</a>. Bringing developing countries, which have suffered the brunt of a problem that they did little to cause, into the Paris agreement was essential. Key to that, said Fabius, was the pledge of financial assistance The French government had to reassure poorer nations at the talks that $100bn a year in financial assistance, for poor countries to cut their emissions and cope with the impacts of the climate crisis, would be forthcoming. “Money, money, money,” Fabius insisted, was at the heart of the talks. “If you don’t have that $100bn [the talks will fail].”</p><p>For the UK as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/01/no-10-accused-of-cavalier-attitude-to-uks-climate-summit-duties" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">hosts of Cop26</a>, the question of money presents more of a problem since the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, swung his axe at the overseas aid budget in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/25/spending-review-2020-rishi-sunak-key-points" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">recent spending review</a>. Although the £11bn designated for climate aid will be ringfenced, persuading other developed countries to part with cash – and showing developing countries that the UK is on their side – has suddenly become more difficult. Amber Rudd, the former UK energy and climate minister who represented the UK at the Paris talks, said: “A country that understood the seriousness of Cop26 would not be cutting international aid right now.”</p><p>Alok Sharma, president of Cop26 and the UK’s business secretary, will draw on his experience as the UK’s former international development minister in dealing with developing countries’ expectations. He said: “I completely recognise making sure we have the finance for climate change action is very important. That’s why we have protected international climate finance. I think people understand we are in a difficult economic situation. We have said when the economy recovers we would look to restore [overseas aid as 0.7% of GDP]. I do think when it comes to climate change we are putting our best foot forward.”</p><p>Boris Johnson will be hoping to smooth over these tricky issues when he, alongside the French government and the UN, presides over a virtual meeting of world leaders this weekend, on 12 December, the fifth anniversary of the Paris accord. At least 70 world leaders are expected to attend, and they will be pushed to bring forward new NDCs and other policy commitments, as a staging post toward the Cop26 summit.</p><p>Johnson kicked off preparations for the meeting last Friday by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/03/uk-vows-outdo-other-major-economies-emissions-cuts-by-2030" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">announcing the UK’s own NDC</a>, setting out a 68% cut in emissions compared with 1990 levels, by 2030. That would put the UK ahead of other developed economies, cutting emissions further and faster than any G20 country has yet committed to do.</p><p>Critics pointed out, however, that the UK is not on track to meet its own current climate targets, for 2023. Far more detailed policy measures are likely to be required, some of them involving major changes and economic losers as well as winners, before the path to net zero is clear.</p><p>The world is facing the task of a global economic reboot after the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic. The green recovery from that crisis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/09/revealed-covid-recovery-plans-threaten-global-climate-hopes" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline in-body-link--immersive">is itself in need of rescue, Guardian analysis has shown</a>, as countries are still pouring money into fossil fuel bailouts. But with so many countries now committed to net zero emissions, and an increasing number coming forward with short term targets for 2030 to set us on that path, there are still grounds for optimism. This week’s climate ambition summit will be an important milestone, but the Cop26 summit next year will be the key test. The Paris agreement five years on still provides the best hope of avoiding the worst ravages of climate breakdown: the question is whether countries are prepared to back it up with action, rather than more hot air.</p><br>

<p>Climate Assembly UK says economic plan should help reach net zero carbon emissions</p><p class="css-vdb1rb">Last modified on Wed 1 Jul 2020 17.16 BST</p><p class="css-38z03z">People would be prepared to continue many of the lifestyle changes enforced by the coronavirus lockdown to help tackle the climate emergency, and the government would have broad support for a<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-green-recovery" data-link-name="in body link"> green economic recovery</a> from the crisis, according to a report.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Working from home is a popular option, along with changes to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/18/a-new-normal-how-coronavirus-will-transform-transport-in-britains-cities" data-link-name="in body link">how people travel</a>, and the government should take the opportunity to rethink investment in infrastructure and support low-carbon industries, the report found.</p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="css-38z03z">The findings come from Climate Assembly UK, a group of 108 members of the public chosen to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/27/first-uk-climate-assembly-birmingham-sir-david-attenborough" data-link-name="in body link">representative of the UK population</a> and to help shape future climate policy by discussing options to reach net zero carbon emissions, in line with the government’s 2050 target.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Nearly eight in ten of the members said the measures taken by the government to help the economic recovery from Covid-19 should be<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/06/uks-coronavirus-recovery-should-have-green-focus-johnson-urged" data-link-name="in body link"> designed to help reach net zero</a>, and an even bigger proportion – 93% – said that, as the lockdown eased, the government and employers should encourage lifestyle changes to cut emissions.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“It was quite clear that many of the assembly members felt this period should be taken as an opportunity to encourage a green economic recovery with a focus on promoting cleaner, greener lifestyles, and an economy that prizes sustainability over short-term benefits that would harm the planet,” said Ibrahim, an assembly member who is a GP from Surrey.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“It feels that climate change is as big a crisis as Covid,” said one respondent. “[We] don’t want the government to put climate change on the back burner because of Covid.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">Another unnamed member said: “It would be too easy to just carry on as before and take advantage of cheap oil and other special offers, [such as] cheap travel, cheap clothes, factories turning out cheap goods, to get the economy going. We need incentives to reduce emissions … and penalties for people who do not consider the environment when building or rebuilding businesses.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">The chairs of the six select committees of MPs who commissioned the Climate Assembly wrote to the prime minister on Monday to say the experience of the coronavirus crisis was likely to make people more receptive to green messages from government.</p><p class="css-38z03z">“In recent months, the UK public has demonstrated its capacity to respond positively and responsibly when they understand the risks posed to them by an invisible threat that demands collective action. We believe that a similar approach, based on securing public support for ambitious policies through open dialogue around the science, is a sound basis for the net zero journey,” they told Boris Johnson in a letter.</p><p>A citizens’ assembly is a group of people brought together to discuss an issue or issues, and reach a conclusion about what they think should happen, according to <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/housing-communities-and-local-government-committee/citizens-assembly-faq-17-19/">the definition</a> put forward by the House of Commons library.</p><p>Citizens’ assemblies give members of the public the time and opportunity to learn about and discuss a topic, before reaching conclusions. Assembly members are asked to make trade-offs and arrive at workable recommendations.</p><p>Facilitated by experts and combining small-group discussions with large-scale debates and a series of votes, members meet over a series of weekends with the goal of removing the conflicts of interest and tribal loyalties that can hamper politicians in reaching a conclusion.</p><p>The people who take part are chosen randomly so they reflect the wider population in terms of demographics – age, gender, ethnicity and social class.</p><p>The number of members involved can vary. A recent citizens’ assembly, formed to examine social care provision in England, had 47 members who were English citizens and eligible to vote in UK general elections.</p><p>Citizens’ assemblies, and other similar methods, have been used in the UK and other countries, including Australia, Canada and the US, to address a range of complex issues. One of the most prominent to take place in recent years was the assembly established by the Irish parliament to address abortion after a decision had been made to have a referendum on the issue.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamie-grierson"><b>Jamie Grierson</b></a>, Home affairs correspondent</p><p class="css-38z03z">Jim Watson, a professor of energy policy at University College London, who spoke to the assembly as an expert, said he was struck by what a “very very strong result” the questions produced. “People are prepared to change,” he said. “[But] they don’t see lifestyle changes in isolation from policy change and what businesses are doing. There is very strong support for the government shaping and directing the economy [towards net zero emissions].”</p><p class="css-38z03z">Their opinions carry no legal weight or official recognition, but the organisers said the assembly members’ views were significant because “there is no other group that is at once a representative sample of the UK population, and well-acquainted with the sorts of measures required to reach net zero”. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/22/uk-citizens-climate-assembly-meet-first-time" data-link-name="in body link">assembly met for three weekends </a>in Birmingham early this year, before lockdown, and since then attended three online meetings in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/16/climate-assembly-uk-concludes-in-world-transformed-by-coronavirus" data-link-name="in body link">April and May</a>.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Citizens’ assemblies have been used in other countries to help guide government decisions on tricky or controversial policy issues, most notably on the 2018 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/22/irish-readers-citizens-assembly-worked-brexit" data-link-name="in body link">referendum on abortion in Ireland</a>. </p><p class="css-38z03z">Their full findings will be released in September, but an interim report on the impact of the Covid-19 crisis is being published on Tuesday because the government is engaged in working out its economic response to the pandemic. The interim findings will also figure in a report by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/21/britain-still-failing-on-climate-crisis-warn-advisers" data-link-name="in body link">committee on </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/21/britain-still-failing-on-climate-crisis-warn-advisers" data-link-name="in body link">climate </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/21/britain-still-failing-on-climate-crisis-warn-advisers" data-link-name="in body link">change this Thursday</a>, which does carry statutory weight, as the government must make a formal response.</p><p class="css-38z03z">Campaigners called on ministers to take note, and plan for a green recovery that would be “mind-blowingly popular”. Muna Suleiman, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s time to push the reset button on our carbon-guzzling and dysfunctional economic system, and prioritise the health and wellbeing of our planet and its people.”</p><p class="css-38z03z">“Now the government has been given an overwhelming mandate for action from the informed public,” said Rosie Rogers of Greenpeace. “[If ministers fail to act] it will be glaringly obvious who they’ve been listening to behind the scenes.”</p><br>

<p>A cleaner, greener future is set out in a detailed new route map towards ending the UK’s climate emissions by 2050 from the Climate Change Committee, the government’s official advisers.</p><p>“These stretching targets will see climate policies increasingly overlap with everyday life, bringing changes in the cars we drive and how we heat our homes,” said Jonathan Marshall, at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. “The overwhelming backing among the British public for climate action means that these measures are likely to be popular and well supported, as long as well-thought policies are used to bring about change.”</p><p>Prof Daniela Schmidt, at the University of Bristol, said: “These actions need to be taken to reduce the risk of climate change impacts in the UK such as drought, crop failures and floods. Such a transition will make the UK a better place to live, with cleaner air, healthier ways of living and greener cities.”</p><p>By 2025, half of new cars sold will be electric, the CCC recommends, with almost half of all cars on the road being electric by 2030. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/12/electric-cars-already-cheaper-own-run-study" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">Electric cars are already cheaper to own and run</a> and purchase prices are falling. Electricity is a cheaper and more efficient fuel than petrol or diesel and the CCC estimates benefits of £8bn a year to consumers by 2035, and a £20bn saving in fuel costs by 2050. But drivers will travel almost as far as today, with annual mileage expected to fall just 4% by 2030.</p><p>Flying produces a lot of carbon emissions and jet fuel is difficult to replace. But the CCC sees air miles falling by only 6% in 2030 compared with 2019, and then rising by 17% in 2050 as low-carbon planes take to the skies. The remaining aviation emissions are offset by tree planting and other measures, which the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/23/make-big-polluters-pay-for-mass-tree-planting-officials-say" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">CCC has suggested be funded by airlines</a>.</p><p>However, this scenario still sees a curbing of the rapid growth of aviation in recent decades, limiting the building of new runways and seeing ticket prices potentially rise. “At the moment, there is no carbon price on flights, although they are one of the most carbon-intensive things that we can do and they are largely done by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/17/people-cause-global-aviation-emissions-study-covid-19" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">very small, largely rich part of the population</a>,” said Mike Thompson at the CCC. “So we ask in the report, should the carbon price be higher?” In an example, the CCC suggests the cost of a return ticket from London to New York would rise by £56 in 2050.</p><p>The cost of more efficient home lighting, appliances and boilers will be offset by the reduced energy they use and the CCC says energy bills would remain level until 2030, after which bills would fall as cheap renewable energy expands further.</p><p>The last gas boiler should be sold in 2033, the CCC said, but new homes are likely to require low-carbon heating a decade earlier. The majority of homes – probably 80% – should be heated by electric-powered heat pumps, which draw warmth from the ground. Installations will rise fifteen-fold from today to 415,000 a year in 2025 and then a million a year in 2030, the CCC said.</p><p>Heat pumps are cheaper to run, but more expensive to buy and homes need to be made highly energy efficient before installation. This will cost £10,000 per home on average, the CCC said, meaning poorer households will need government help. It estimates that adding £3bn a year to existing efficiency schemes would cover the total cost and suggests ministers end regressive green levies on energy bills and move the levies to general taxation.</p><p>“Calling time on gas boilers will represent a major step on the UK’s path to a carbon neutral nation, and is a way for families up and down the country to take action on their carbon footprints,” said Marshall. “It will also reduce air pollution.”</p><p>The CCC has also recommended that no home should be sold after 2028 without an energy efficiency rating (EPC) of C or better. Julie Hirigoyen, at the UK Green Building called this “radical but welcome”.</p><p>Some homes may be able to install hydrogen boilers but the CCC said only in areas where a low-carbon industrial cluster has been founded to produce clean hydrogen. The Humber region is a likely site for one cluster.</p><p>Modern low-carbon industries will grow, building renewable energy, decarbonising the UK’s 28m homes, capturing carbon from power stations, producing hydrogen and creating new woodlands, the CCC said, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout the UK.</p><p>For example, the programme to retrofit buildings alone would require over 200,000 extra full-time workers from 2030 through to 2050, the CCC said. But it said it was important for the government to support those losing jobs, such as in the oil and gas industry, into the new roles.</p><p>Ana Musat, at the Aldersgate Group of businesses, said: “As more countries [like China and Japan] take on net zero emissions targets, the export opportunities for the UK could be significant.”</p><p>Red meat and dairy has a large impact on the environment and a series of recent reports have found that people in rich nations need to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/new-plant-focused-diet-would-transform-planets-future-say-scientists" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">slash their consumption</a> to deal with the climate crisis and improve their health. The CCC plan is less radical, requiring a reduction in meat eating of 20% by 2030 and 35% by 2050, and instead increasing the ambition of action in other areas.</p><p>Public sector caterers serving billions of meals a year in UK schools, universities, hospitals and care homes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/16/school-and-hospital-caterers-vow-to-cut-meat-served-by-20" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">pledged in April to cut the amount of meat they serve by 20%,</a> equivalent to 45,000 cows or 16 million chickens a year. The CCC said action to cut food waste by 50% by 2030 is also needed, such as better product labelling.</p><p>The CCC recommends the UK becomes a greener and more pleasant land, with about <a href="https://theconversation.com/climate-crisis-how-to-make-space-for-2-billion-trees-on-a-crowded-island-like-the-uk-128098" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">2bn new trees</a> leading to a 40% increase in woodland areas, a level not seen in Britain for 1,000 years. Trees would cover 15% of the country by 2035 and 18% by 2050, up from 13% today.</p><p>The woodlands would absorb carbon from the air, but also boost wildlife and provide more opportunity for people to visit green spaces, which is known to increase wellbeing. But Nick Phillips, at the Woodland Trust, said: “On current trends, we will get nowhere near this [tree cover] target. Policies like the upcoming England Tree Strategy and new farm payments system need to be visionary and bold.”</p><p>Peatlands cover 10% of the UK and store huge amounts of carbon but are mostly degraded. The CCC recommends half are restored by 2030 and 80% by 2050. Lord Deben, chair of the CCC, said the sale of peat as garden compost should be banned immediately.</p><p>“It is quite wrong that we should be restoring peatlands, but still allowing the sale of horticultural peat,” he said. “There is no reason for us to be using it now – it’s ridiculous.”</p><p>The CCC said about one-third of farmland needs to be converted to forestry and growing crops that can be burned in power stations which capture CO2 emissions, thereby removing carbon from the atmosphere. Food production can be boosted with greater efficiency and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/30/environment-to-benefit-from-biggest-farming-shake-up-in-50-years" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">farmers would be paid for helping to fight climate change</a>.</p><p>Martin Harper, at the RSPB, said: “The CCC report highlights the vital role nature plays in locking up carbon. Now the UK government needs to pick up the gauntlet, stop burning our precious peatland and invest in restoring nature for wildlife, for people and for a safer climate.”</p><br>

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>n Poole, 41-year-old teacher Kate Salter said a low-traffic neighbourhood (LTN) had transformed her community. Salter was involved in proposing the measures to her council, which came into force at the end of August.</p><p>“As soon as the planters went in, there was a change in the volume of traffic. It was quiet, you could hear birds singing, and neighbours were having a chat for the first time. Before, you couldn’t hear each other over the road because of the noise of the busy traffic, and wouldn’t just pop over and leave the kids. Now we’ve all become really good friends,” she said.</p><p>“There’s an older lady who lives on our road, and her bike got stolen. We all put in a tenner and bought her a new one. That wouldn’t have happened before.”</p><p>“People are changing their behaviours already, like walking, picking up their children rather than driving,” she added. “If more people cycle and walk, there will be less traffic. I have to drive sometimes, but it doesn’t add much time to my journey, and that sacrifice is worth it to feel safer on the road and have that community spirit.”</p><p>However, not everyone living under an LTN has found the transformation a positive one.</p><p>Daniel, 33, lives on a main road leading to the South Circular in London’s Hither Green, where an LTN was introduced soon after the first national lockdown in March. He felt that the measures deepened divide between wealthier and poorer residents, increasing pollution for those living near main roads.</p><p>“The LTN measures have moved traffic away from the Manor House side of Hither Green where a three-bedroom house costs £1m, to the poorer side nearer Catford, where we live,” he said.</p><p>“The traffic leading on to the South Circular is now gridlocked every day and created a massive bottleneck. The streets under the LTN are really nice, but they’ve just pushed it all towards Catford,,” he added.</p><p>Daniel said he supported a greening of his local area, but felt it should be approached differently. He suggested the council focus on incentivising people to take public transport, or increasing opportunities for charging electric cars.</p><p>“We all want a greener <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag" class="u-underline">London</a> but this is no way to go about it,” he said. “If you want fewer car journeys overall, then residents need more incentives and less punishment. More carrot, less stick.”</p><p>Daniel’s concerns were echoed by others who contacted the Guardian via a call out. One of those was 35-year-old engineer Yacob Ahmed, who lives on the edge of Hyde Park in Leeds where an LTN was implemented in early November. His opposition to the scheme centred largely on the impact on the business community.</p><p>“I’ve spoken to businesses who are very concerned,” he said. “The postmaster has said if it keeps impacting him, he’ll have to close up. Deliveries and suppliers are being affected, with couriers getting lost and lorries unable to drop off supplies because the road blocks are taking up parking spaces.”</p><p>According to Ahmed, the measures didn’t make the streets safer.</p><p>“It’s not safer if cars and lorries are stuck, and having to reverse back out on to the main roads, and in areas without cars going up and down, they’ve effectively created mugging hotspots,” he said.</p><p>“We care about the environment too, we care about air quality too,” he added. “I just don’t think the landscape of Hyde Park is compatible with such a scheme.”</p><p> But other readers, who were initially opposed, found that living with less traffic and more peace eventually changed their minds. Emily Holman, a 33-year-old commercial manager in football who lives in Sydenham, south London, initially opposed the introduction of the LTN on her road in late June, but said her concerns were mainly about the lack of communication.</p><p>“It was a shock,” she said. “Some flower planters just arrived one day, and then they put the bollard up. I would have expected to get a note or letter through the door, and it would have been great to get consultation.”</p><p>Since the LTN was introduced, Holman has changed her views, and hopes it will remain in place after the trial period.</p><p>“It is an inconvenience from a driving point of view, but from a resident’s point of view I prefer it,” Holman said. “We’ve lived in the flat for six years, and have seen a number of car crashes and bumps. With the road closed, that’s stopped.”</p><p>“If they’d educated people about the fact that they were doing it to improve air quality, there would have been a better reception,” she added.</p><p>One 45-year-old resident, who preferred not to be named, praised the handling of the issue by her local councillors in West Greenwich, who she said have been engaging with residents for nearly four years. She said that before the six-month trial of the LTN, the councillors held workshops and meetings, open engagement events for people to assess the plans, and conducted a survey with 900 people, modifying the scheme according to their feedback.</p><p>Before the LTN was introduced in late August, she described her street as “hideous” with pets hit by vehicles, near misses involving children and arguments over log-jammed traffic.</p><p>While she said the scheme had been “controversial”, on her road the positive changes since the introduction of the LTN had been immediate.</p><p>“You can see children on their bikes, and my neighbour who has lived here for 40 years said he’d seen children playing hopscotch in the street for the first time,” she said. “It’s like the old days. It’s created a haven.”</p><br>
