The flock was further boosted in February with the release of 49 captive-bred juveniles, increasing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/27/numbers-of-critically-endangered-orange-bellied-parrot-soar-from-low-20s-to-more-than-100\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">total number heading north for the winter to 118</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Protecting the budgie-sized species when it is on the move is difficult given migrating birds fan out across the southern mainland and Tasmania\u2019s north-west.

At its lowest point three years ago, the breeding population in the wild fell to 17, including just three females. It means the species has a significantly reduced gene pool, increasing the risk of disease having a species-wide impact as remaining birds have similar patterns of immunity.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Despite the increase in numbers, the parrot population is still considered perilously low and reliant on scientific intervention.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A study <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/17/orange-bellied-parrots-all-but-extinct-survive-tasmanian-summer-only-to-die-migrating\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">published earlier this year</a> found up to 2017, the work at Melaleuca, which includes providing nest boxes and food, had increased the number of birds that leave the breeding ground but had no impact on overall survival.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Its lead author, Dejan Stojanovic from the Australian National University, said at the time it suggested the recovery program needed to be holistic and attempt to deal with risks during migration as well as boosting numbers during breeding.

But the latest research shows the birds are even smarter than thought: they know where and when their meals are being served.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The research was conducted in Bristol but related behaviour has been reported from Spain to Japan. The scientists think that the gulls\u2019 ability to adapt to a human timetable is one reason <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/16/gulls-gulls-gulls-how-the-seaside-birds-took-over-urban-britain\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">populations of gulls have soared</a> in cities in the last 40 years.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In Bristol, the researchers followed herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls that nest on roofs near the city centre. A dozen had small GPS backpacks fitted in order to track their movements and the scientists also observed their behaviour at their favourite feeding spots in the summer of 2018.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThey are super-smart,\u201d said Anouk Spelt, at the University of Bristol. \u201cAt the school there were not many gulls around until break time. Then you saw them sitting on the rooftops. The moment the bell went off, they all flew up and started looking for leftovers.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">She said she was not too surprised at the gulls\u2019 ability to learn when food was available as they had heard stories, including birds regularly knocking on windows at 6pm looking for dinner leftovers. \u201cWe\u2019d heard all these anecdotes but now we can show it\u2019s definitely true,\u201d Spelt said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The research is the most in-depth analysis of how urban gulls find food. Another recent study in Spain showed yellow-legged gulls can <a href=\"https://movementecologyjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40462-020-00205-x\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">time their visits</a> to rubbish dumps. Earlier work in Japan showed <a href=\"https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v466/p249-259/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">gulls visited fish processing plants</a> and markets at the best times.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The analysis, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ibi.12892\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">published in the journal Ibis</a>, showed the average number of gulls present at the school was three times higher when the children were outside eating their snacks or packed lunches at morning break or lunchtime. The scientists spent a month observing a school, a waste site and a park. The GPS data showed the gulls visited 25 schools, with their visits always most common at break times.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">At the rubbish site, new waste was only unloaded during working hours on weekdays and this was when the most gulls flew in. \u201cThe predictable timing of food at these sites appears to have resulted in the birds adopting a sit\u2010and\u2010wait approach, instead of actively searching for food,\u201d said the researchers. \u201cThis may allow them to minimise the time and energy foraging.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The gulls\u2019 visits to the park were usually in the early morning and did not coincide with human activity. Instead, the researchers saw them searching for worms and insects, which are present in higher numbers during these early hours.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cMost people don\u2019t really like gulls \u2013 they are aggressive,\u201d said Spelt. \u201cSo we wanted to show why these gulls are in cities and what moves them to be around humans.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Cities offer safer rooftop nesting sites, warmer temperatures and more readily available food. \u201cSo there are many different reasons, but we now think that [the ability to adapt to human timetables] is one of them,\u201d she said. Spelt hopes research like this will help councils better understand gull behaviour and manage potential nuisances.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">For the problem of food being snatched out of people\u2019s hands, other researchers reported a solution last year.

Overnight red-eye flights and weary hours in airport lounges may be banished, but they have been replaced with \u201cvirtual jet lag\u201d as he toggles between discussing various countries\u2019 needs and aims, from high-emitting major economies to small island states fearful for their very existence.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Murton has a close understanding of the issues many developing countries face: he has worked extensively in Africa since researching his PhD in Kenya about 25 years ago, most recently as UK ambassador to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and as deputy high commissioner in Nairobi. \u201cI personally think my experience in Africa helps,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to have access to electricity, transport and so on. The west has to help the poor to enjoy the fruits of economic development [while avoiding climate change]. You have to find ways.\u201d He has also served in Japan and at Nato headquarters.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The envoy is one of a tight-knit team of UK officials leading the talks, under Alok Sharma, the UK\u2019s business secretary and president of Cop26. The 190-strong Cop26 unit sits within the Cabinet Office, with close links to 10 Downing Street and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, and with the UK\u2019s global network of hundreds of ambassadors and business advocates, all of whom have taken on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/19/france-launches-global-drive-for-climate-deal\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">focus on the climate</a> as the UK prepares for what will be its first major outing on the world stage after Brexit.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The UK will also hold the rotating presidency of the G7 group of industrialised countries next year, and is expected to make climate a key focus there in preparation for Cop26. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, will convene, alongside UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/23/climate-crisis-must-not-be-overshadowed-by-covid-johnson-to-tell-un\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">separate preparatory meeting of world leaders this December</a>: the virtual \u201cclimate ambition summit\u201d will mark five years since the Paris agreement in 2015, and will be a key test of ambitions for Cop26.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Murton\u2019s colleagues include Mark Carney, the UN special envoy on climate action and finance, and former governor of the Bank of England; Archie Young, chief negotiator; Nigel Topping, the UK\u2019s business champion; Nick Bridge, special representative for climate change at the Foreign Office. The all-male lineup, which also includes ministers Lord Zac Goldsmith and Lord Callanan, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/21/uk-plan-all-male-team-host-cop26-un-climate-summit-angers-activists\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">drawn sharp criticism</a> for its lack of diversity, though the government said women were represented at many other levels. The latest addition is Anne-Marie Trevelyan, former secretary of state for international development before her department was shut down, who was announced last week as the UK\u2019s international champion for adaptation and resilience for Cop26.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Online diplomacy has some clear advantages. As well as lower emissions from taking fewer flights, being online means Murton can communicate with several different countries in the course of a single day, instead of visiting each in turn.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">One surprising outcome is that developing countries are sometimes better able to participate in virtual forums than in the physical world. Many poor nations have high-speed internet connections and 4G or 5G networks, meaning ministers and officials can be reached easily, whereas poor nations sometimes struggle to send large teams to physical meetings.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Twitter is also an unexpected boon. While some of the world\u2019s major news outlets are often criticised for not giving the breakdown of the Earth\u2019s climate the attention it deserves, social media is hot on the subject. Murton has found it provides a useful way for the UK\u2019s global network of climate advocates to highlight their work.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But nothing can make up for meeting people face-to-face and forging personal connections beyond the detail of countries\u2019 official negotiating lines. \u201cIt\u2019s about that time over a meal when you talk about something else, about people\u2019s families or their pets, that you make real relationships,\u201d said Murton.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">So far, the timetable for negotiations leading up to Cop26 has simply been put back by a year, but the strain will soon start to be felt when it comes to the details of the talks. Though the big decisions on what commitments countries will offer will be made by heads of government and high-ranking ministers, there are hundreds of pages of detailed text to be worked through as part of putting the Paris agreement into effect. Preparatory talks on those line by line technical issues, that would have taken place in May and September, have been postponed, and no formal negotiations have yet taken place.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In the next few months, the UK and the UN will have to decide whether to wait for travel restrictions to be lifted or allow the formal negotiations to take place virtually. The UK view is that there is no appetite yet for formal negotiations to move online, but if lockdowns drag on in key countries that could yet change.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In the meantime, Murton is \u201cdrinking a lot of tea and coffee\u201d while he switches among video meetings, and working from home much of the time means he can help to look after his son during the intervals \u2013 which also means, every so often, he quietly switches off the camera for a nappy change.</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/todd-wilkinson"], "tags": ["Environment,National parks,US news"], "title": ["'A fowl of the law': men sentenced for cooking chicken in Yellowstone hot spring"], "date": ["2020-11-10T08:10:03.000Z"], "images": ["<img class=\"gu-image\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\" alt=\"Sign says 'do not mark bacterial mats'\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10bab83791467a2cd5b5a0ce47844a69699df9b4/0_0_2047_1365/master/2047.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=12570c83204f70aa09fa0dde22129bfc\">"], "body": ["<p>When it comes to unthinking human behavior in America\u2019s premier nature preserve, the retired Yellowstone historian Lee Whittlesey can reel off the examples.</p>", "<p>There is the tourist who took a selfie in front of a bison only to be tossed in the air by it. There is the drone that crashed into bubbling park waters. And then there\u2019s the latest story, which has driven him both to vexation and to punning.</p>", "<p>Three tourists were charged and sentenced last week for preparing supper by boiling chickens in one of the park\u2019s natural hot springs. Not only did they \u201crun a fowl of the law\u201d, Whittlesey says, they \u201ccooked their own goose\u201d by doing something a bit harebrained.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt surprised me,\u201d said Whittlesey, a four-decade tour guide in the park and author of the book Death In Yellowstone: Accidents and Foolhardiness in the First National Park. \u201cWhen I place them within the larger milieu of American tourists, it probably isn\u2019t that extraordinary.\u201d But because they were from the region, he said, they should have known better.</p>", "<p>Morgan Warthin, a Yellowstone spokesperson, said that two Idahoans and a Utah man toted two \u201ccooking pots\u201d into a remote part of the park in August, where they dipped a pair of whole raw chickens, held in a burlap sack, into one of the Shoshone Geyser Basin\u2019s boiling geothermal features.</p>", "<p>One of the accused told a judge his intention was to \u201cmake dinner\u201d. The three men, all in their 40s and 50s, were handed harsh sentences, according to court documents. They received fines ranging between $540 and $1,250, and unsupervised probation; two of the men spent a couple of days in jail. All three are banned from entering Yellowstone.</p>", "<p>The men could not be reached for comment, but they are far from alone. Since its creation in 1872, the natural wonders and wildlife of Yellowstone have endured their share of abuse. Looting and defacing of park treasures was the reason why the US army had to be called in and stationed there for decades, Whittlesey notes.</p>", "<p>In the early years, when well-heeled tourists could only get there by railroad and tour the park via stagecoach, the geothermal features, of which Old Faithful Geyser is the most famous, have been utilized for a number of dubious purposes.</p>", "<p>Some tourists washed their clothes in hot springs. Anglers at the West Thumb Geyser Cone, located along the shores of Yellowstone Lake, landed trout and cooked them in the scalding water. And thousands upon thousands of people tossed coins into hot pools, treating them as wishing wells. Such thoughtless actions can clog the fragile subterranean vents feeding the dozens of prismatic-hued pools.</p>", "<p>Warthin shared statistics confirming that in 2020, there have been nearly three times more violations involving geothermal features than the recent annual average. To date this year, 122 arrests have been logged involving tourists having to post bonds and make court appearances. </p>", "<p>These statistics do not include thousands of verbal warnings issued by rangers, or other kinds of ticketed offenses that include harassing and feeding wildlife, driving vehicles off roads and taking objects as souvenirs.</p>", "<p>One tourist seeking a treasure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/16/buried-treasure-forrest-fenn-rockies\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">allegedly hidden by a New Mexico millionaire</a> was recently punished after digging for it in a historic Yellowstone cemetery. Two summers ago, a drunken visitor taunted an agitated bison as if he were a matador.</p>", "<p>Basting chicken in Yellowstone\u2019s geothermal stew is dangerous and illegal, because it involved the men walking across thin, breakable crusts above the water. In addition, the hot springs and their water chemistry, which host specially adapted and colorful mats of micro-organisms called thermophiles, are fragile.</p>", "<p>While the chicken incident elicited chuckles, Whittlesey says danger lurks in Yellowstone. In June 2016, a young visitor died and his body was never recovered after he ventured off a boardwalk in the Norris Geyser Basin and crashed through the crust of a superheated and highly acidic spring.</p>", "<p>\u201cAre people ecologically and behaviorally smarter today?

They\u2019ve been used for decades on rangelands such as the Crowhill Sauders\u2019s to restore waterways. They do this by preventing erosion, filtering out nitrogen and phosphorus from manure, cooling and feeding water-bound ecosystems.

But to succeed, they need to incentivise cash-strapped farmers who may not realise that various grants exist to pay for them, and who may be sceptical of their usefulness. The Crowhill Sauders, for example, at first only agreed to their buffer because it provided a route to installing a much-needed culvert to keep the spring from flooding their property.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Over on the west coast, researchers are looking into riparian buffers\u2019 potential to yield farmer income from carbon credits.

Another factor, according to Lamonte Garber, watershed restoration coordinator for the Stroud Water Research Center in Avondale, PA, is management: \u201cFarmers have to figure out how to pay for practices that might complicate their operation,\u201d such as erecting fencing to keep cattle out of the water, and planting trees and shrubs that usurp land from pasture.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The Crowhill Sauders already had a fence \u2013 their farm\u2019s previous owners used it to keep cattle <em>in</em> the water on hot days. And they weren\u2019t sure why they needed more trees along their already verdant streambank. But consultant Austin Unruh of Crow &amp; Berry Land Management in Lancaster County explained that the new plantings would fill in critical gaps. And the Crowhill Sauders could choose any fruit- and nut-bearing trees and shrubs they wanted. Harvestable buffers are a niche interest, but <a href=\"https://www.chesapeake.org/stac/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/FINAL_STAC-Report_Multifunctional-Buffers_12.20.2019.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">research</a> shows them to be potentially profitable.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In ocean-adjacent Marin and Sonoma counties, part of the largest dairy state, California, riparian buffers have long been adopted by ranchers and dairy farmers to improve water quality \u2013 70% of the state\u2019s drinking water runs through rangeland. Riparian buffers can cool streams and otherwise improve habitat for the region\u2019s endangered and threatened <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/endangered-species-conservation/central-california-coast-coho-salmon\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">coho salmon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/steelhead-trout\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">steelhead trout</a>, as well as mitigate wildfires, which have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/06/california-wildfires-gigafire-first\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">raging out of control in the state for months</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Sonoma and Marin county dairy farmers, averaging around 700 acres and 300-plus head of cattle, tend toward organic grazing practices (unlike much larger confined feeding operations inland in the Central Valley). David Lewis, director of the University of California Cooperative Extension Marin County, points out that riparian buffers make pastures more efficient in these lands, because managing them requires farmers to figure out how to distribute cattle more uniformly, which improves grasses and soils.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">He says that\u2019s one way to incentivise farmers to adopt measures that could result in an additional 5,400 acres of riparian restoration here: \u201cAnything that can reduce off-farm feed purchases, which eats into the bottom line, is a win.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Another way might be through carbon credits. California counties are required to meet state greenhouse gas emission <a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/ab-32-climate-change-scoping-plan\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">reduction targets</a>. \u201cPeople are looking at ways to connect the dots on what can happen on farms, and build momentum to carry out more riparian restoration,\u201d says Lewis.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">California\u2019s Department of Conservation is currently developing a \u201ccreek calculator\u201d to \u201cfigure out how much carbon results from stream restoration,\u201d says Lewis. Dairy cooperative Organic Valley recently launched a pilot program with two of its farmers \u2013 funded with private, state, and federal money \u2013 to get a baseline understanding of \u201cwhat practices sequester carbon that are appropriate for our membership\u201d, according to the company\u2019s director of sustainability, Nicole Rakobitsch.<br><br>Although there\u2019s a lot of hype and no formal market for farm-generated carbon credits yet, Rajat Panwar, a business sustainability professor at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, expects it to quickly emerge as companies start to act on their carbon-neutral pledges. \u201cIf there ever gets to be a way to be paid for carbon credits that isn\u2019t more trouble than it\u2019s worth we will be interested,\u201d says Tim Crowhill Sauders.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><em>Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/animals-farmed/2018/feb/21/animals-farmed-join-us-for-monthly-updates-newsletter-updates\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Animals farmed monthly update</a> to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

It also works with farmers to protect biodiversity and advises the government on environmental policy, planning and licensing.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Defra\u2019s funding for the agency has dropped by \u00a3165m since 2008, and as a result it is struggling to carry out these statutory duties, according to Prospect trade union\u2019s Natural England 2020-21 report. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain weirdness to working in Natural England in that everyone knows that we\u2019ve been absolutely cut to the bone,\u201d one employee told the Guardian. \u201cEveryone knows we can\u2019t do basic statutory stuff, let alone the bigger, exciting projects we want to do.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Following a decade of cuts, this year the agency was awarded an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/18/natural-england-funding-boost-gets-cautious-welcome-aoe\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">additional \u00a315m</a> to recruit around 200 new staff, including roles to help deliver the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-bill-2020\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Environment bill</a> legislation going through parliament. While the report welcomes this investment, it calls it a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d and warns that \u201curgent, radical investment is needed\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cPublic awareness of the plight of biodiversity and fragility of our landscapes has finally come to the fore \u2026 but it is clear from the trajectory of both funding, pay and staff numbers that to meet the ambitions and challenges set out in this report, and to not let the green recovery fall flat, government must step up and make good the damage done,\u201d the report says.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Natural England\u2019s \u201clack of money is affecting everybody because it is the paymaster for a lot of local nature conservation efforts \u2013 it\u2019s the spider in the middle of the web,\u201d said author and conservationist Peter Marren. \u201cI don\u2019t think most people have ever heard of Natural England, it\u2019s not a high-profile public body. This is happening because nobody cares about it \u2026 apart from the tight circle that work in nature conservation.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Natural England teams are increasingly being centralised in small regional hubs due to staff shortages. Management of SSSIs \u2013 which cover 8% of England \u2013 is mostly dealt with remotely, by email and phone. Previously, one person would manage 10-15 SSSIs, now they have up to 40. More than <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/925414/1_Extent__and_condition_of_protected_areas_2020_accessible.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">60% of SSSI sites</a> are in \u201cunfavourable\u201d condition, and half of them haven\u2019t been monitored in six years, which is a statutory duty, meaning the reality could be worse.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Pay has been an ongoing issue at Natural England. Last year staff were in their eighth year of a 1% cap on pay, which has since been lifted. Only 9.5% of staff believe their pay adequately reflects their performance and the gender pay gap across the agency is 8.4%.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">One employee, who left last summer, told the Guardian she was earning \u00a320,000 for four days a week and worked two extra jobs to make ends meet. She had been working for a decade before joining the agency and had two first-class degrees from Oxbridge. When she raised the pay issue with her manager she said she was told, \u201cit\u2019s normal for people in Natural England to have second and third jobs to get by\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">She described working at the agency as stressful: \u201cNatural England staff are the medics of the environment and they are watching their charges \u2013 the environment, species, habitats \u2013 going extinct and rotten every day. The grief and trauma of working in the natural environment in this country is intense. In Natural England it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This week staff were planning to strike over pay issues. In response, Natural England set up a pay reform project and union leaders have given the agency six months before it will consider industrial action again. A union representative told the Guardian; \u201cIt\u2019s hurtful that we\u2019re not valued like our counterparts in Defra. Our work is technical, specialist and high risk, but not properly recognised by the government and yet it depends on us for advice. It\u2019s a plea, really, for the government to recognise the vital work that Natural England does for nature and people.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Public sector investment in conservation has fallen in real terms by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/15/uk-miss-most-biodiversity-targets-conservation\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">33% in five years</a>, according to the 2020 biodiversity indicators report. Natural England chair Tony Juniper has previously said that ongoing budget cuts have left the organisation <a

depleted\u201d</a>, and he has been lobbying for more funding.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Mike Clancy, Prospect union general secretary, said there was a \u201cyawning gap\u201d between the government\u2019s rhetoric on climate change and biodiversity, and the reality of years of underfunding environmental agencies.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cProtecting nature means investing in the people who do that work,\u201d he said. \u201cNatural England is at the heart of this agenda but it can only be effective if it is properly funded and the importance of its staff properly recognised.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Natural England has an \u201cabsolutely critical job\u201d in turning around catastrophic wildlife decline, said Craig Bennett, chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Wildlife</a> Trusts. \u201cIf our nation is to have the natural world that we yearn for, then ministers need to give Natural England the money and powers it needs to do its job, and let it get on with it.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Green party peer Natalie Bennett said people protecting nature are doing so \u201con a shoestring\u201d due to the severity of cuts. \u201cWe\u2019re one of the world\u2019s most nature-depleted countries, yet Natural England has been under-resourced at every turn and this threatens the work of its expert staff \u2026 clearly funding needs to be restored.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Marian Spain, chief executive of Natural England, said the agency is embarking on a nature recovery network, rebuilding resilient landscapes, restoring wildlife, improving soil health, and helping people to connect to the natural world. \u201cOur staff do an extraordinary job in caring for the natural world and we are committed to making sure they are rewarded fairly for their hard work,\u201d she said in the comment, which came via Defra.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThis government has set out ambitious environmental targets, which Natural England is well placed to deliver on \u2013 however ongoing and significant investment will be needed if we are to truly realise the ambition of leaving the environment in a better state than we found it.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><em>Find more <a

Here are some of the regional frontrunners.</span></p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Under the coalition of its socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Spain has picked up the pace from a jog to a run in its break from fossil fuels this year, and is now one of the countries leading the European pack.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Last week, the government was the latest to <a href=\"https://elpais.com/clima-y-medio-ambiente/2020-11-03/espana-aprueba-su-estrategia-para-desterrar-los-combustibles-fosiles-en-tres-decadas.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">announce plans</a> to go carbon neutral by 2050 and it is overseeing one of the fastest shifts away from coal the world has seen.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Over the coming three years, Spain has committed \u20ac27bn to green energy spending \u2013 a downpayment on the \u20ac750bn investment it forecasts will be needed to fund the move away from fossil fuels. By 2050, the decarbonisation strategy envisages a 90% reduction in emissions, the reforestation of 20,000 hectares and the recovery of 50,000 hectares of wetlands. Renewable power, meanwhile, will rise from 20% of the energy mix to 97%.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Action is already under way. In May, the cabinet approved a draft law on climate change, which outlined more ambitious goals than the EU at the time on renewables and energy efficiency. The bill would ban new coal, oil and gas extraction projects and end direct fossil fuel subsidies.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Spain is also shutting down 69% of its coal-fired power plants this year and next \u2013 a pace of decommissioning <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-climatechange-coal-idUSKCN24M32C\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">not seen anywhere else</a> in the world. Last year, Spain installed more new onshore wind than any other country in Europe.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Far from being a drain on employment and economy, the Spanish government says its decarbonisation plan will increase the workforce by 1.6%. But the country will have to convince investors that its legal framework is more stable this time than during the \u201csolar garden\u201d bubble that followed subsidy promises in 2007. When those were abolished, confidence in the sector took at hit along with jobs.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The ecological transition minister, Teresa Ribera, predicts the country will go <a href=\"https://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2020/10/19/spain-vows-to-step-up-fight-against-climate-change-by-boosting-renewable-energy\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">well beyond the 2030 targets</a> set by the European commission and has promised to push for still more ambitious policies in Spain and elsewhere in Europe.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This is part of a broader trend. In Europe, renewables have generated more power than coal for the first time this year. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said she wants Europe to be the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral continent. Over the next 10 years, the commission forecasts investment of at least \u20ac1tn to achieve this goal, including a quarter of the EU budget. This month, the European parliament voted in favour of climate neutrality by 2050 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/08/eu-parliament-votes-carbon-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reduction-2030\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">60% cuts in emissions</a> by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels). Further progress has been seen in individual countries, including Denmark, Germany, France and (outside the EU) Britain.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Four years after being labelled the world\u2019s biggest carbon villain, South Korea has bid to be one of the heroes this year with a $61bn Green New Deal and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/28/south-korea-vows-to-go-carbon-neutral-by-2050-to-fight-climate-emergency\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">a commitment to go carbon neutral by 2050</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">President Moon Jae-in has moved to end South Korea\u2019s dependence on coal and create green jobs as his party promised in April\u2019s successful election campaign for the national assembly.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">By 2025, the Green New Deal would bring about 230,000 more energy-saving buildings, 1.13m electric and hydrogen-powered cars, and an increase in renewable energy capacity to 42.7 GW from 12.7 GW last year.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Money will also be made available to upgrade public rental housing and schools to make them zero-energy, and to expand green areas in cities. To improve energy efficiency, smart meters will be fitted in an additional 5 million apartments and communities will be given incentives to connect to micro-grids supplied with decentralised, low-carbon energy.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The plan aims to support Korean industrial conglomerates that have been hard hit by the pandemic. Hyundai, Kia, Samsung and EM Korea will be among the biggest beneficiaries of plans to build 45,000 new electric vehicle charging points and 450 hydrogen refuelling units.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Tempering the optimism is South Korea\u2019s past record of high emissions and false hopes. The last time the country promised \u201cgreen growth\u201d \u2013 after the 2008-9 financial crisis \u2013 it led to an environmentally disastrous policy of more concrete riverbanks and higher emissions. Today, coal supplies about 40% of Korea\u2019s electricity and seven new coal power plants are under construction. In 2016, activists labelled South Korea the world\u2019s biggest carbon villain.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A new generation of campaigners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/could-a-green-new-deal-turn-south-korea-from-climate-villain-to-model\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">believe South Korea has turned a new page</a>. They want to see an early halt to overseas coal financing and a strong 2030 target to reduce domestic emissions.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">They are encouraged by signs of a climate race-to-the-top in east Asia, where the opposite has long been true. China and Japan are also major users and funders of coal, but both countries have committed this year to carbon-neutral goals.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Last year, Uruguay was ranked fourth in the world in the proportion of electricity it supplies from wind and solar. The International <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Energy</a> Agency said the country\u2019s 36% share was behind only Denmark (50%), Lithuania (41%) and Luxembourg (37%). If hydropower is added, Uruguay leaps ahead of them all with 97%.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This represents a spectacular transition. Twenty years ago, this South American country burned oil to produce almost a third of its electricity and had to import power from Argentina. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/uruguay-makes-dramatic-shift-to-nearly-95-clean-energy\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">The change came between 2008 and 2015</a> under former presidents Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/18/-sp-is-this-worlds-most-radical-president-uruguay-jose-mujica\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Jos\u00e9 Mujica</a>, who wanted to reduce costs and make energy more affordable.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The secret was a proactive state rather than a big-spending one. Government encouraged investors by promising fixed feed-in tariffs and stable policies. More than US$7bn poured into the sector, helping Uruguay to reduce its emissions by 20%. Droughts have also been rarer because the grid is less dependent on hydropower.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Asad Rehman, the co-organiser of Global Green New Deal Campaign, said the success of Uruguay\u2019s transition reflects an ideal balance of social and climate priorities. \u201cIt is not just about carbon, but also cutting energy prices and tackling energy poverty. Social justice is an imperative.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The picture is mixed elsewhere in South and Central America. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/25/costa-rica-plan-decarbonize-2050-climate-change-fight\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Costa Rica</a> has won international kudos for generating almost all of its electricity with renewables, particularly geothermal and hydropower. The latter also provides most of the power for Brazil and Paraguay though it often has a devastating impact on ecosystems and wildlife.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Renewables already provide more than 93% of Kenya\u2019s electricity and the government plans to expand further so everyone in the country has access either to the grid or community solar power by 2022.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The carbon footprint of the population of 47 million is tiny compared with wealthy nations in the northern hemisphere so economic \u2013 rather than climate \u2013 considerations are the main drivers for an energy transition. Solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal energy is increasingly cheaper and more practical than fossil fuels. The main challenge is securing the initial investment.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The country has substantial renewable resources to tap, prompting many observers to say it has the potential to bypass fossil fuel-driven economic development. Last month, the African Development Bank announced the completion of the 105 MWe Menengai geothermal power plant in the Rift Valley, cementing Kenya\u2019s leading role on the continent for geothermal electricity production, which has increased more than fourfold in the past six years.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Kenya is also home to east Africa\u2019s biggest solar generation plant \u2013 the $128.5m China-funded Garissa Plant where more than 200,000 PV panels soak up the energy from the sunshine each day. In many remote areas, small villages that are far from the grid are able to generate electricity with just a few dozen rooftop panels.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">These developments \u2013 along with expanded wind and hydropower \u2013 have pushed the proportion of the population with electricity from 63% in 2017 to 75% today.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Heymi Bahar, the lead author of the International Energy Agency\u2019s Renewables market report, said Kenya along with other African nations, such as Rwanda and Nigeria, \u201chave a chance to leapfrog\u201d fossil fuel energy systems if they can draw in more private investment. That once meant expensive subsidies, but Bahar said this is no longer the case. Good regulations and policies are enough.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cRenewables are becoming cheaper and more accessible. In Africa, the potential is there, the willingness is there,\u201d he said. \u201cRenewables do not need subsidies any more. They just need long-term revenue streams. That is determined by clear policies.\u201d</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker"], "tags": ["Nigel Farage,Transport policy,Cycling,Politics,Life and style,Environment,Transport,UK news"], "title": ["Farage's anti-cyclist article shows car users fear loss of control"], "date": ["2020-11-11T07:00:31.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p>Bike-friendly measures introduced during lockdown have led rightwing populists to revive much-disproved myths</p>", "<p class=\"css-vdb1rb\">Last modified on Wed 11 Nov 2020 09.25 GMT</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><span class=\"css-1r9pv9q\"><span class=\"css-1ac5g5w\">I</span></span><span class=\"css-38z03z\">f you\u2019re a fan of the historical notion that progress doesn\u2019t move as a straight, upward line but tends to be a bit more wiggly, then there was <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8924869/NIGEL-FARAGE-Stop-pious-pay-road-tax-obey-rules-like-motorists.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">an article about cycling</a> in this week\u2019s Mail on Sunday that very much proved the point.</span></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Anti-cyclist pieces in the Mail are not exactly uncommon, but this one was notable because its key argument was that cyclists should \u201cpay road tax\u201d.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">If this blogpost were a film, this would be the moment to insert a sudden, soundtrack-halting needle scratch, with a narrator filling the sudden silence to say: \u201cYes, road tax.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">You <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2011/nov/22/cycling-road-tax-confused\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">know the one</a>.

Even more notable was the author of this Mail on Sunday opinion piece \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Nigel Farage</a>. And to find Farage weighing in on the subject of cycling interests me.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In political terms, we are currently amid what could be called version 3.0 Farage. Brexit is all but over, and his plan B of being a Donald Trump camp follower/media pundit took a significant dent at the weekend.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But Farage is nothing if not adaptable, and is currently reinventing himself as something of an all-purpose, hard-right, populist culture warrior, whether warning about an \u201cinvasion\u201d of asylum seekers in the Channel or <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54777346\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">battling lockdown</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">His article on cycling is both at times openly ludicrous \u2013 he opines that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of road cyclists frequenting the Kent lanes where he lives are also most likely remainers \u2013 but also illustrative of the language adopted by rightwing populists, featuring dehumanising terms such as likening cyclists to \u201ca strange swarm of insects\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Farage has, presumably, held these golf club bore opinions about cyclists for many years. So why air them now? The clue comes later in the article, when he condemns government spending on ways to boost walking and cycling amid lockdown, such as temporary bike lanes and so-called low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs).</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This is the key. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cycling\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Cycling</a> is in the news, and it means that once again we must face a rash of unsavoury anti-cyclist opinion pieces, among which Farage\u2019s is just the latest.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A fortnight ago, a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/i-cant-keep-abreast-of-what-cyclists-want-bj58rtv0q\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">columnist in the Times</a> used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/26/uk-cycling-groups-say-rule-on-riding-side-by-side-is-causing-confusion\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">proposed changes to the Highway Code</a> to better protect vulnerable road users to complain about cyclists \u201cstamping their feet\u201d, saying \u201cthe fact they\u2019re pedalling the eco-friendly option has already gone to their heads\u201d. This is another traditional trope about those on two wheels \u2013 they\u2019re smug, self-righteous or, as Farage put it, \u201cpious\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">On the same day, the Telegraph got in on the act, hosting a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Telegraph/status/1321048995570081792\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">ridiculous Twitter \u201cdebate\u201d</a> that started with the argument: \u201cCountry walks can be ruined by arrogant cyclists expecting walkers to know they are coming up behind at 40mph.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A reminder: even in a brief time trial, professional cyclists competing in the Tour de France do well to manage 30mph. This is yet another complaint about cyclists \u2013 they\u2019re always too fast, except when they\u2019re too slow and holding up motor traffic. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cyclist.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">What should we make of this mini-resurgence in much-disproved myths about cyclists? My view is that it is in no small part based on a sense of threat. Not threat from cyclists themselves \u2013 it remains extraordinarily difficult to seriously harm another person while riding a bike.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The threat instead is being felt by powerful interests who fear their decades of dominance is being threatened. The government\u2019s response to coronavirus, in terms of how to keep people moving when capacity on public transport is necessarily limited, has not actually been that revolutionary. Yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/09/uk-to-invest-cycle-lanes-coronavirus-air-pollution\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">\u00a3250m in emergency spending</a> is welcome but, in road transport terms, that is less than a fifth of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-47290440\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">a very expensive roundabout</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">My sense is that the rapid change to life brought by coronavirus is making some people who habitually drive fear that the roads could be next, and both the rhetoric and political pressure are ramping up. More than a dozen Conservative MPs have <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8931805/Tories-demand-end-cycle-lane-chaos.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">signed a letter</a> calling, in effect, for all new work on cycle lanes and LTNs to halt.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">My worry is this pressure could soon have an impact. Nigel Farage is nothing if not a politician who can sense which way the wind is blowing. So yes, let\u2019s laugh at silly notions of road tax and 40mph weekend cyclists.

Instead, there has been a glut of new domestic coal financing.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Similarly, dirty power projects dominate energy spending overseas on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Belt and Road Initiative</a>, China\u2019s global infrastructure development strategy introduced in 2013 to invest in nearly 70 countries and international organisations. Analysts say this needs to change if the world is to have any chance of keeping temperature rises to the Paris accord goal of between 1.5C and 2C.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Much will depend on China\u2019s next five-year plan, being drawn up by the central committee. Although these deliberations have received scant media attention compared with the US election, they are more important in climate terms. <a href=\"https://energyandcleanair.org/how-to-tell-a-strong-chinese-five-year-plan-from-a-weak-one/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Energy experts say</a> an ambitious Chinese strategy would reduce coal use to less than 50% of the energy mix and increase renewables to around 25% by 2025. If the government also put in place an emissions cap, it would mark a positive step forward.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">More important still would be a commitment to shift the focus of Belt and Road investment to renewables, which could see China leading the global transition away from fossil fuels. \u201cThe most critical recovery is China,\u201d says Bob Ward of the Grantham Institute at LSE. \u201cIt holds a lot of debt in other countries and funds dirty industries overseas. If it continues, that it will undermine global efforts to cut emissions.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The world\u2019s other two main coal financiers, Japan and South Korea, also have a role to play. Both recently set 2050 zero-carbon goals, which is encouraging in the long term, but if their governments are serious about climate action, they need to overcome resistance from old-fashioned industries \u2013 notably Toyota and Hitachi in Japan and Doosan in South Korea \u2013 and send a clear message that all future investment must be fossil-fuel free.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Donald Trump has been the face of climate denial for the last four years, but his defeat will not be enough to transform the US into an engine for global green recovery unless the Democrats can regain control of the Senate.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Joe Biden, the science-friendly president-elect, is already assembling a team of climate experts. On taking office in January, he will almost immediately rejoin the Paris agreement. Whether this will be anything more than a symbolic victory will depend on the division of power in Congress.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">If the Democrats can win the Senate run-off in Georgia and tie the number of seats in the upper chamber, then the vice-president-elect, Kamala Harris, should have the deciding vote on climate legislation and budgets, such as the $2tn green new deal promised in the campaign. If, on the other hand, the Republican party maintains control of the Senate, it is likely to continue to block ambitious action and international cooperation, as it did during the Clinton and Obama presidencies. Powerful lobbyists, well funded by the likes of Exxon, Chevron and Koch Industries, will also continue to deny, delay and disrupt. Legal challenges will go to the most conservative supreme court in recent memory.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Rob Jackson, chair of the Global Carbon project, fears division will once again stymie action at the national level. \u201cI don\u2019t see a path to the green new deal in the current political climate here,\u201d he says. \u201cA divided Congress would almost certainly mean that a big-picture climate bill wouldn\u2019t happen over the next two years, and president Biden will be unlikely to get anything big through Congress.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">All is not lost. Jackson notes state-level actions have been leading the climate agenda in the US regardless of who is in the White House. Another big question is whether Wall Street will call time on fossil fuels, which would change everything. Unlikely as it seems, if the US could unite around a massive green stimulus programme, this would ripple positively across the world.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Europe is setting the green recovery pace, but it would be progressing at a substantially faster clip were it not for lobbying by powerful carbon-intensive industries such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/21/greta-thunberg-accuses-meps-of-surrender-on-climate-and-environment\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">farming</a> in France, coal in Germany and Poland, or oil in the UK and Netherlands.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This is also true for the aviation sector, which has evaded responsibility for cutting CO<sub>2</sub> in national climate plans. Airbus, Lufthansa, KLM and other carriers have long campaigned against higher airline taxes, binding targets for green fuel and low-carbon aircraft. Industry organisations including Airlines for Europe and Airlines for America have influenced Brussels to relax or drop emissions trading requirements.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Industry watchers say this resistance may be softening because of Covid, with airlines and plane-makers desperate for bailouts. This gives governments the leverage to insist on something in return. In Germany, Lufthansa has been told its public advocacy must align with Europe\u2019s climate objectives, which should halt lobbying against ambitious green standards and stronger obligations under the emissions trading scheme. In France, the head of Airbus, Guillaume Faury, is starting to talk of \u201ccarbon-based decision making\u201d. He wants to take advantage of a scrappage scheme to replace older polluting aircraft with cleaner new models and to win funding for research into hydrogen or electric aircraft. Spain, now the fastest mover in Europe, is mandating greater use of clean fuels.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Not all the changes are as progressive as they seem. In the Netherlands, KLM has become an enthusiastic supporter of higher standards for inter-European flights, though that is less impressive when you realise this accounts for only 20% of its business.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Andrew Murphy, aviation director at the NGO Transport &amp; Environment says he is cautiously optimistic.<strong> </strong>\u201cThings are changing in the way industry is behaving. Because they need government support, they are not openly opposing action as they used to do,\u201d he says.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The crucial test will be a debate about the EU\u2019s revised emissions reductions targets. \u201cThat will be a big decision,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cThe EU should be explicit that aviation is included in emissions targets.\u201d Just as important, he says, will be Europe\u2019s willingness to move ahead without waiting for the rest of the world and the laggard UN aviation agency, Icao, which has been susceptible to industry pressure, particularly from the US.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cMind the Gap\u201d should be stamped across the top of every climate briefing document handed to Boris Johnson over the next year, or the UK\u2019s hopes of hosting a successful UN climate conference will founder in accusations of hypocrisy.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Cop26 is likely to be the most important international event of the prime minister\u2019s tenure. The gathering, in November 2021, aims to go a step further than the Paris agreement, prompt governments to set more ambitious targets, and put the world back on track to keep global heating to between 1.5C and 2C above pre-industrial levels. It is also the most likely way for \u201cBritain\u2019s Trump\u201d to reach out to Biden, with whom he shares little common ground.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In public, Johnson is increasingly positive about climate action, but he has a long way to go before he can convince anyone he is genuinely enthusiastic. As a newspaper columnist, his position on cutting emissions was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/tory-mps-five-times-more-likely-to-vote-against-climate-action\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">lukewarm</a>; as an MP, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/11/guardian-climate-score-how-did-your-mp-do\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">climate voting record</a> was even cooler.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The UK also has a gap to make up. Successive governments have presented themselves as global climate leaders. This administration boasts of being a frontrunner in setting a 2050 goal for carbon neutrality. But climate campaigners say long-term targets are irresponsible unless matched by action in the near term. The UK is still off course, even for the goals it set five years ago.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Long-term observers say the moment ought to be ripe to make a big change after Covid. Until now, however, \u201cgreen recovery\u201d plans announced by the government have failed to impress.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cMy feeling is this government would be in a better place to do a proper green new deal than any previous because of it clearly being an interest of Johnson\u2019s and because the fiscal constraints are suddenly off,\u201d says Douglas Parr, chief scientist and policy director at Greenpeace UK. But he fears this is not yet a sufficiently urgent political priority, the public is wedded to cars, and UK institutions such as Ofgem, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), and local authorities are not designed or funded enough to act at the speed and scale of change required.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Others fear Johnson\u2019s inner circle contains too many sceptics, including those who previously worked for rightwing thinktanks such as the Institute of Economic Affairs and TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, both of which opposed proposals for a green new deal after the 2008-9 financial crisis.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Many senior conservative politicians, despite talking up a green recovery from the pandemic, remain wedded to old industries. <a href=\"https://desmog.co.uk/2020/11/10/beis-government-ministers-fossil-fuels-meetings-covid-green-recovery\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">New data from the investigative journalist group DeSmog UK</a> found BEIS ministers met BP, Shell and other fossil fuel producers almost 150 times in the early months of the lockdown, and renewable energy producers only 17 times.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t reveal what is said in those meetings. But the level of access the industry gets implies that, at best, ministers are mainly listening to big polluters when planning a green recovery, or at worst are disregarding it in order to prop up the fossil fuel industry,\u201d says Mat Hope, the editor of DeSmog UK.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Whichever is true, there is a credibility gap to close if the next Cop host wants to lead by example.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">From Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire to populists such as the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, rightwing resistance to pro-climate government intervention takes many forms. But a starting point is disinformation: undermining climate science in the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal or the Australian, downplaying the link between human emissions and extreme weather events such as fires, floods and droughts in news reports, or distracting attention with false equivalences such as the recent call on world leaders to <a href=\"https://clintel.org/message-clintel-fight-virus-not-carbon/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">\u201cfight the virus not carbon\u201d</a> by the Climate Intelligence foundation (Clintel), a European group opposing climate action with links to British Conservatives and similar parties in the European parliament.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Opponents of green new deals say they are poor value for money and climate risks are exaggerated. In the UK, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, co-founded by the former UK chancellor Lord Lawson, recently put out a <a href=\"https://www.thegwpf.org/the-fatal-attraction-of-a-post-covid-green-deal/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">paper</a> warning against a post-Covid green recovery package on the grounds that more wind and solar would make energy more expensive. Similar arguments are put forward in two recently published books by Bjorn Lomborg and by Michael Shellenberger.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/09/false-alarm-by-bjorn-lomborg-apocalypse-never-by-michael-shellenberger-review\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Critics say</a> such claims are refuted by the sharply falling costs of renewables, which are often now cheaper than coal and oil, and the cost of inaction: worsening forest fires, droughts, hurricanes and floods.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The increasingly evident global toll of the climate crisis makes out-and-out denial all but impossible. Instead, the extreme right shift their doubt-mongering toward ideology. Brazil\u2019s foreign minister, Eduardo Ara\u00fajo, suggests climate campaigns are part of a global Marxist plot. His boss, Bolsonaro, says environmental NGOs trying to protect the Amazon are part of a foreign conspiracy to stifle economic development. Neither has provided a shred of evidence to back up their accusations.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Brazil, meanwhile, is heading in the opposite direction of a green new deal. The state-led oil company Petrobras recently sold off its shares in renewable energy. The government is basing its hopes for economic recovery on opening up the Amazon to more mining, farming and logging. Once Trump leaves office, Bolsonaro will replace him as the global face of climate disruption.</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fiona-harvey"], "tags": ["US news,Joe Biden,Climate change,Environment,World news"], "title": ["US election result boosts preparations for UN climate summit"], "date": ["2020-11-11T06:00:30.000Z"], "images": ["<img class=\"badge-slot__img\" src=\"https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/badges/9e7cc995edb9a33408a0286e21c3bc66/the-last-chance.svg\" alt=\"The last chance\">"], "body": ["<p>Preparations for the next vital UN summit on the climate \u2013 one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/09/world-is-running-out-of-time-on-climate-experts-warn\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">last chances</a> to set the world on track to meet the Paris agreement \u2013 have been given a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/08/joe-biden-paris-climate-goals-0-1c\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">boost</a> by the election of Joe Biden as president.</p>", "<p>The election caps a remarkable few weeks on international climate action, which have seen China, the EU, Japan and others commit to long-term targets on greenhouse gas emissions to fulfil the Paris climate agreement.</p>", "<p>Biden has vowed to return the US to the Paris agreement, from which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/30/how-trump-emboldening-other-countries-bad-behavior-climate-crisis\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">Donald Trump withdrew</a>, and to set a goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, commitments that were underlined by his references to the climate crisis in his speeches after the result became clear.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe difference [between the US under Biden and under Trump] will be night and day,\u201d said Todd Stern, climate envoy to Barack Obama. \u201cThis is critical. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" class=\"u-underline\">Joe Biden</a> understands [the climate crisis] and that it will be about how we collectively drive a transformation to a net zero economy.

We are looking at the same conjunction of the planets now with the US, the EU, China, Japan \u2013 if the big ones are going in the right direction, there will be a very strong incentive for all countries to go in the right direction.\u201d</p>", "<p>That brightens the prospects considerably for the next UN climate summit, Cop26, which would have taken place this week, in Glasgow, had the Covid-19 pandemic not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/26/cop26-climate-talks-in-glasgow-likely-to-be-delayed-again\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">forced a postponement</a>.

Leading nations have made a spate of commitments that have transformed the prospects for Cop26: countries responsible for more than half of global emissions and two thirds of the global economy are now committed to net zero emissions by mid-century \u2013 the goal that scientists say is vital to avoid the worst ravages of climate breakdown.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/22/china-pledges-to-reach-carbon-neutrality-before-2060\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">China surprised the world in late September</a>, when President Xi Jinping told the UN general assembly that his country would reach net zero emissions by 2060 and cause its greenhouse gas production to peak by 2030.

Four years of Donald Trump have done huge damage to the US\u2019s reputation. But the world\u2019s biggest economy, and second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases (after China), remains vastly influential. With President Biden in charge, the prospects for next year\u2019s Cop26 talks in Scotland, when drastic emissions cuts must be agreed if the world is to stand a chance of avoiding catastrophic heating, are already brighter.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">President Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/04/us-paris-climate-agreement-exit-election\" title data-link-name=\"in body link\">withdrawal of the US</a> from the Paris agreement was a key plank of his nationalist \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda and an act of sabotage against both the UN climate process and the principle of a rules-based international order.

With Mr Biden, that cover is gone, and ecocidal policies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/12/amazon-matter-of-life-and-death-for-all-of-us-we-must-fight-for-it\" title data-link-name=\"in body link\">Amazon rainforest destruction</a> and coal-power expansion should come under renewed and relentless pressure.

Conservative judges are a further roadblock. Legislation to limit emissions and punish polluters is certain to be challenged all the way to the supreme court. Fossil-fuel companies and other vested interests remain a formidable force. Nor can public support be taken for granted. Most voters are on board in principle, recognising the dangers of unchecked global heating. But the changes in lifestyle that will be needed to meet new targets, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/04/uk-health-professions-call-for-climate-tax-on-meat\" title data-link-name=\"in body link\">reductions in meat-eating</a> and flying, are challenging in the US as in other rich countries.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Still, Mr Biden\u2019s presence in the White House will be a huge opportunity, and one that the environmental movement and its supporters must seize with every hand they have. Global heating is a fact, not a hypothesis or ideology. It is not just the vast majority of Democrats who want their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/12/scorching-tucson-bucks-us-trend-to-put-climate-justice-at-centre-of-plans\" title data-link-name=\"in body link\">politicians</a> to do more to tackle it, but also a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/21/how-americans-see-climate-change-and-the-environment-in-7-charts/\" title data-link-name=\"in body link\">sizable minority of Republicans</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/02/climate-crisis-differences-old-and-young-families\" title data-link-name=\"in body link\">Younger people are the most anxious</a>.

Mr Biden\u2019s climate taskforce was chaired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman and star of his party\u2019s progressive wing. Now, if they are to create sufficient momentum, Democrats must look beyond the ranks of committed green supporters, as the writer Arlie Russell Hochschild did in her book Strangers in Their Own Land, about environmental politics in Tea Party-supporting Louisiana.

Heralded as the \u201csingle largest investment in the seafood industry by any Indigenous group in Canada\u201d, the landmark deal comes at a critical moment for Indigenous communities in the region, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/23/why-indigenous-crews-in-canada-were-shot-at-with-flares-for-fishing\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">tensions remain high</a> over their treatied fishing rights.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cFor 13,000 years, the Mi\u2019kmaq have sustainably fished the waters of Atlantic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Canada</a>, and today, on this truly transformational day, we are owners of a global leader in the fishery,\u201d Chief Terrence Paul of the Membertou wrote in a letter to community members, announcing the purchase. \u201cFor so many years, our communities were not welcome to participate in big industry. Today, on our own terms we are 50% commercial owners.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Partnering with Vancouver-based Premium Brands Holdings Corporation, a number of Mi\u2019kmaq communities will put up C$250m (\u00a3145m) for their share of the purchase. The Mi\u2019kmaq will have full ownership of Clearwater\u2019s coveted offshore fishing licences, which allow the harvest of lobster, scallop, crab and clams in a massive tract of ocean known as LFA 41. They also plan to bring more Indigenous peoples into the company\u2019s ranks.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">For decades, Clearwater has been a giant in the industry, with a monopoly on offshore fishing licences, which allow for year-round lobster harvest. But as of last year, amid lagging performance, the company signalled it was looking for a buyer. The Membertou First Nation, based in the Cape Breton region, had previously shown an interest in expanding its reach into the commercial industry, when it paid Clearwater C$25m (\u00a314.5m) for two of the company\u2019s eight licences in September.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIn order to be in business, you first have to play the game,\u201d Paul told CBC News after the purchase was announced. \u201cYou have to play to win, and we won.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In addition to Membertou and Miawpukek supporting the deal, a number of other groups in the region, including the Paqtnkek, Pictou Landing, Potlotek, Sipekne\u2019katik and We\u2019koqma\u2019q First Nations, have also expressed an interest in acquiring a stake in Clearwater.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The purchase comes at a critical moment for the Mi\u2019kmaq people, who have been at the centre of a tense <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JorgeBarrera/status/1307045768386183168\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">and at times violent</a> battle over their right to harvest lobster.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In early September, members of the Sipekne\u2019katik First Nation in Nova Scotia launched their own self-regulated inshore lobster fishery as an exercise of their treaty rights, setting traps during a period in which the season is closed.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Commercial fisherman in the area responded aggressively, harassing the Indigenous boats, cutting their traps and destroying their catch. In late October, a lobster pound rented by the <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/lobster-facility-nova-scotia-fire-1.5765665\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Sipekne\u2019katik was set on fire</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">At issue for both sides is the interpretation of a 1999 supreme court ruling, which came after a Mi\u2019kmaq activist, Donald Marshall Jr, was barred from harvesting eel out of season, despite claiming a treaty right to fish. The country\u2019s highest court determined Indigenous peoples had a right to fish their ancestral waters in the pursuit of a \u201cmoderate livelihood\u201d. But the court also issued a <a href=\"https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1999/1999canlii666/1999canlii666.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">clarifying decision</a>, which determined that the federal government has the authority to regulate fisheries in the public interest and for conservation.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">For two decades, the federal government has failed to clearly define the scope of a \u201cmoderate livelihood\u201d fishery and how it would apply to Indigenous peoples.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWe need to sit down with First Nations and do what we should\u2019ve done 250 years ago. We need to review fishery plans and implement them together,\u201d fisheries minister Bernadette Jordan told reporters in October, calling the violence \u201cdisgusting\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The purchase of Clearwater, while it marks a tectonic shift in the industry, doesn\u2019t resolve the ongoing issues over the \u201cmoderate livelihood\u201d fishery.

This is an emergency and we had to ring the bell.\u201d</p>", "<p>The action plan is a work in progress, but Romero said key goals would include upgrading city buildings to be 100% powered on renewables, electrifying public transport and investing in long-neglected urban communities to make them healthier, more liveable places, in order to curb urban sprawl, according to Romero, the first woman and first Latina to be elected mayor.</p>", "<p>Tucson is Arizona\u2019s second largest city after Phoenix, with almost 1 million habitants. Its rapidly growing sprawl encroaches on precious desert landscape, increases traffic and depletes already limited water sources. Extreme heat isn\u2019t new in Arizona, but it is getting worse as the planet gets hotter and hotter.</p>", "<p>As temperatures rise and rainfall declines, air pollution is increasing along with associated health conditions such as asthma.

I hope the climate emergency declaration will help us, but it will require getting everyone onboard and depends on politics at the state and national level, too.\u201d</p>", "<p>Joe Biden, who won Arizona by half a percentage point in last week\u2019s US election, has promised to rejoin the Paris climate agreement on day one of his presidency. At the state level, votes are still being counted in some key races but it looks like the Democrats will not flip either chamber, despite a multimillion-dollar effort. This could lead to obstacles for Tucson and other cities and counties trying to implement climate mitigation plans.</p>", "<p>Tucson, a Democrat-leaning city, and the historically mostly Republican state of Arizona have since the 1990s come up with bold sustainability plans on water, public transport and renewable energy. Tucson was among almost 4,000 cities, states, tribal leaders, universities, faith leaders and CEOs to sign the <a href=\"https://www.wearestillin.com/about\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">We Are Still In declaration</a>, committing to climate action after Donald Trump announced that the US would leave the Paris accord.</p>", "<p>Recent popular policies in Tucson have included an incentive-based reclaim and reuse water programme, an electric tram system connecting low-income black and brown communities, and a tree-planting initiative to mitigate some of the worst heat islands.</p>", "<p>But advocates say that over the past three decades, progress has been stalled and plans diluted as a result of corporate influence at local and state levels. For instance, a statewide policy requiring developers to have 100 years of water resources for new projects has been eroded by the state legislature, while strong commitments to phase out coal have ended up favouring natural gas rather than solar and other renewables. Without joined-up action across the region, activists fear that developers and farmers will simply move their water-guzzling ventures to outside the city limits.</p>", "<p>Nevertheless, Romero is adamant that the climate emergency declaration is not an empty political statement but will lead to action demanded by voters and fuel change nationally.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe most progressive federal climate actions started as city-led grassroots initiatives,\u201d she said. \u201cClimate action and environmental equity always starts from the bottom up.\u201d</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["Mark Hillsdon"], "tags": ["Biodiversity,Conservation,Environment,Wildlife,Agriculture,Science,Climate change,Greenhouse gas emissions,Plants"], "title": ["Dry run: the wet farming experiment that could sow seeds for future crops"], "date": ["2020-11-12T07:30:02.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p>Cambridgeshire project trials plants that thrive in more extreme weather, including sphagnum moss and bulrush</p>", "<p class=\"css-vdb1rb\">Last modified on Tue 17 Nov 2020 13.41 GMT</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><span class=\"css-17ehqsd\"><span class=\"css-1ljoi60\">A</span></span><span class=\"css-38z03z\"> road deeply rutted by tractors and trucks winds its way across the Fens in Cambridgeshire, a flat, expansive landscape where trees are the exception, not the rule, and ditches rather than hedges divide the fields.

The <a href=\"https://www.greatfen.org.uk/big-ideas/wet-farming\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Water Works project</a> is testing new crops that could suit a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/25/climate-change-uk-weather-wet-dry-met-office\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">future UK climate</a>, when weather events are expected to be more extreme and rain arrives in a deluge. Using plants that thrive in saturated soil, it is setting out to show the commercial benefits of re-wetting these peatlands, a process that will also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/28/ultimate-bogs-how-saving-peatlands-could-help-save-the-planet\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">lock carbon into the ground</a>.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The trial site covers just five hectares (12 acres) and a grant from the People\u2019s Postcode Lottery has made the project possible.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Lorna Parker, the restoration manager for the wider<a href=\"https://www.greatfen.org.uk/about-great-fen\" data-link-name=\"in body link\"> Great Fen</a> project, a 100-year plan to re-wet 3,700 hectares of peat across Cambridgeshire and one of the largest restoration projects of its kind in Europe, hopes the Water Works trial will prove inspirational to local farmers and food producers. \u201cWhat we are doing here is trying to showcase potential crops that could tolerate high water tables,\u201d she says.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The 10 bunds that make up the site have been sunk about 2ft down, and half a dozen volunteers from Natural England and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Wildlife</a> Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Northamptonshire (WTBCN) are undertaking the back-breaking work of planting more than 200,000 plugs. Once each bund is finished, water that is rich in sediments and nutrients is allowed to flood back in from a holding pool.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The first two plots contain bulrush, a hardy, native plant, which can be used for animal fodder, fuel and building materials, such as fibre board and cavity wall insulation. Next comes common reed, which already grows in abundance along the field\u2019s margins. It is another fuel crop that is also good for packaging, while its sap can be turned into a snack with a taste similar to popcorn.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The volunteers work quickly. Helen Bailey, from the WTCBN, says they have developed a slick method, taking it in turns to collect the plugs of spindly plants and lay them out on top of the harrowed soil, before a colleague plants them.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Sweet manna grass \u2013 a western equivalent of wild rice \u2013 takes up the next two plots. It was harvested in the wild across continental Europe until the middle of the last century, although it has never been developed as a commercial crop. Milled, it can be used for porridge.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">These new crops will also filter the water until it reaches the final two bunds, planted with the prize crop, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/15/plantwatch-is-sphagnum-the-most-underrated-plant-on-earth\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">sphagnum moss</a>. Famed for its medicinal qualities and absorbency \u2013 it was used as a wound dressing in the first world war \u2013 today it is being touted as a natural lining for nappies, although companies have been unable to take the idea forward as harvesting sphagnum from the wild is impractical and in many cases illegal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Now, working with what Parker calls \u201csphagnum gurus\u201d, this could change. \u201cBy changing the water level you change the whole microclimate of the area,\u201d she explains. Every morning a mist called occult precipitation hangs over the bunds, changing the temperature of the soil and allowing the sphagnum moss to thrive.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The moss is also loved by orchid fanciers, who use it to pot their plants. It is currently imported from China and New Zealand and comes with thousands of air miles, making a commercial domestic crop all the more desirable. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">There are also two beds for novel crops, wetland species such as water mint, which can be used for wrapping cheese, and meadowsweet, once a popular flavouring for gin. \u201cYou can grow a niche product with a really high-value end use,\u201d says Parker. Wild celery and cranberries are also set to be trialled.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The trial brings together the <a href=\"https://www.wildlifebcn.org/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Wildlife Trust BCN</a>, wet farming experts from the University of East London, and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, which is studying the effects of high water levels on carbon sequestration.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The site sits<em> </em>in what is dubbed \u201cthe bathtub of Britain\u201d, with the surrounding farmland lying as much as 4m below sea level. This was once <a href=\"https://www.greatfen.org.uk/about-great-fen/heritage/whittlesea-mere\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Whittlesea Mere</a>, the largest lake in lowland England. Although just a few feet deep in parts, at one point it stretched six miles across and regularly staged sailing regattas and ice-skating races. The waters were rich in fish and wildfowl, and locals harvested the marshy shore for sedge and reed. But with a growing demand for farmland, by 1850 the mere had been deemed a nuisance, and despite protests was pumped dry over the following 18 months.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Even though today this is one of the driest parts of the UK, the pumps are still running. Under the fields is a network of pipes that regularly draw water from the land and takes it out into the sea near King\u2019s Lynn. In a wet year, as much as 160bn litres of water is sucked out, both to stop flooding and to make the land suitable for crops such as wheat and barley. But these cereals have been adopted from drier, more arid countries, explains Parker, and the extraction leaves the land vulnerable. The Fens <a href=\"https://www.greatfen.org.uk/blog/kate-carver/getting-underway-again-water-works\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">lose 4.5 million cubic metres of peat a year to soil erosion</a> and in 50 years at best, she says, there will be no soil left to farm.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cEither it blows away when it\u2019s dry, or it oxidises and releases the CO2 that it\u2019s been holding for centuries into the atmosphere,\u201d she adds.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But turning off the pumps, and planting crops that can thrive in boggy ground, could help reverse this trend, while maintaining a water table that sits 10cm below the surface will stop carbon from escaping.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Raising the water level also means that existing pockets of wetlands will be less isolated, boosting biodiversity. Within days of re-wetting the site, snipe were spotted, while other waders, as well as Chinese water deer, have also been seen.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The project organisers are already talking to local farmers about growing crops in these conditions. Hannah Darby manages an arable farm a few miles away at Sawtry Fen. Like Parker, she is passionate about saving the Fens, and already farms using techniques such as no-till, which helps to keep carbon in the soil.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">She is excited about paludiculture and has already visited the site, but she is also realistic. \u201cWe have to make sure we are viable,\u201d she says. More work needs to be done on the end market for these crops, as well as how to store water.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cPaludiculture could be one way of mitigating climate change,\u201d she agrees. \u201cBut this is actually one of the driest parts of the country. We don\u2019t have much rainfall here. When we do, it\u2019s quite extreme \u2026 heavy bursts, then we\u2019ll have six weeks of dry weather.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWe need more infrastructure to store the water in terms of reservoirs when it\u2019s dry \u2013 it\u2019s not quite as simple as just turning the pumps off.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWe\u2019re not pretending we\u2019re farmers, this is just a shop window, a conversation starter,\u201d says Parker. And while in a few years\u2019 time this small corner of Cambridgeshire may look lush and beautiful, she acknowledges that their efforts will probably have been overtaken. \u201cPeople will be doing things differently, and probably better,\u201d she says.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><br></p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fiona-harvey"], "tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions,Cop26: Glasgow climate change conference 2021,Climate change,Green politics,Renewable energy,Economic policy,Environment,Politics,UK news"], "title": ["Reaching UK net zero target cheaper than we thought, says climate adviser"], "date": ["2020-11-12T07:00:01.000Z"], "images": ["<img class=\"badge-slot__img\" src=\"https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/badges/9e7cc995edb9a33408a0286e21c3bc66/the-last-chance.svg\" alt=\"The last chance\">"], "body": ["<p>Reaching net zero carbon emissions in the UK is likely to be much easier and cheaper than previously thought, and can be designed in such a way as to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/06/uks-coronavirus-recovery-should-have-green-focus-johnson-urged\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">quickly improve the lives of millions of people</a>, a senior adviser to the government has said.</p>", "<p>Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, the UK\u2019s independent statutory adviser, said costs had come down rapidly in recent years, and past estimates that moving to a low-carbon economy would cut trillions from GDP were wrong.</p>", "<p>\u201cOverall, the cost is surprisingly low \u2013 it\u2019s cheaper than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/02/this-report-will-change-your-life-what-zero-emissions-means-for-uk\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">even we thought last year</a> when we made our assessments.

da Cunha, a volcanic archipelago in the south Atlantic and part of the UK\u2019s overseas territories, has announced that almost 700,000 sq km of its waters will become a marine protected area (MPA), the fourth largest such sanctuary in the world.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In doing so, the community will safeguard the area\u2019s wealth of wildlife, including

the size of Britain and 2,400km from the nearest habitation, Saint Helena.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">James Glass, Tristan da Cunha chief islander, said: \u201cOur life on Tristan da Cunha has always been based around our relationship with the sea, and that continues today. The Tristan community is deeply committed to conservation: on land, we\u2019ve already declared protected status for more than half our territory.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cBut the sea is our vital resource, for our economy and ultimately for our long-term survival.

He said: \u201cWe are in danger of killing our seas. We are warming them up, making them more acidic and every day we fill them with turtle-choking, dolphin-poisoning plastic that is turning our ocean into a vast floating rubbish dump.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWe need collective global action if we are to bequeath a world that is every bit as wonderful and magnificent as the one we inherited.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The RSPB described the new MPA as the \u201cjewel in the crown of UK marine protection\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Beccy Speight, its chief executive, said: \u201cTristan da Cunha is a place like no other. The waters that surround this remote UK overseas territory are some of the richest in the world. Tens of millions of seabirds soar above the waves, penguins and seals cram on to the beaches, threatened sharks breed offshore and mysterious whales feed in the deep-water canyons. From today, we can say all of this is protected.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Lord Goldsmith, UK minister for the environment, described the announcement as a \u201chuge environmental win\u201d and a \u201ccritically important step in protecting the world\u2019s biodiversity and ecosystems\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">However, some NGOs contrasted Britain\u2019s support for marine protection in its overseas territories with its record on safeguarding marine habitats at home.

It snowed only once during their three weeks on the water.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">While the world on average has warmed more than 1C because of human-caused climate change, the Arctic is heating much faster. The researchers found the shallow waters were up to 3C hotter than is typical throughout the water column. This year marked the second-biggest sea ice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/oct/13/arctic-ice-melting-climate-change-global-warming\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">retreat</a> toward the North Pole ever, after 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Many Arctic science trips were canceled due to the pandemic.

But often the objections are based on assumptions that vary from the misplaced to the downright incorrect. Here are some of the myths.</p>", "<p>In essence, low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) are residential roads in which bollards, planters or strategic \u201cpoint closures\u201d allow vehicle access to all addresses in a neighbourhood but reduce through traffic. Along with vehicle barriers, pavement widening and other measures are also often introduced. This is intended to make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists as well as reduce air and noise pollution.</p>", "<p>It is often argued that because many LTNs focus on residential streets and because property prices tend to be lower on busier roads, all the schemes do is push pollution and noise towards poorer people. But the evidence does not bear this out. A University of Westminster study found that among all age, income and ethnic groups, almost 90% of people live on roads that could be part of an LTN, and that there were few noticeable differences across the various demographics.</p>", "<p>More generally, moves to reduce overall motor traffic, which LTNs aim to do, tend to help poorer households, which are less likely to own and use cars but still suffer the impact of their ubiquity.</p>", "<p>This is a particularly common theme \u2013 to call LTNs \u201croad blocks\u201d. This is untrue, not least as pedestrians and cyclists have exactly the same access as before. But even for cars and vans, no address is cut off. The only block is to through traffic, intended to prevent residential streets being used as rat runs. Yes, some shorter car trips might take longer \u2013 but that is part of the point, to nudge people towards different modes of travel.</p>", "<p>There is an extent to which some objectors to LTNs have a point in that some arrived very quickly during the response to coronavirus, alongside assorted temporary bike lanes and wider pavements. This was while a lot of emergency measures were brought in for the pandemic.</p>", "<p>The government has recognised that the next wave of LTNs need more consultation. But Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/13/local-councils-advised-to-push-ahead-with-traffic-reduction-schemes\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">has told councils</a> that this must be done objectively, and not merely as a chance for noisy objectors, if they are a minority, to block any plans.</p>", "<p>This annoys some disability transport campaigners, who say it is insulting to treat people with disabilities as a single bloc, with identical needs. Yes, some disabled people are heavily reliant on cars or taxis. But other find it easiest to get about using wheelchairs, or adapted bikes or trikes, where quieter streets are an advantage.</p>", "<p>This is a genuine factor that has to be taken into consideration with LTNs. Some councils have, after consulting fire or ambulance services, for example, changed a junction to replace physical barriers with camera-enforced signs.</p>", "<p>But overall, there has been almost no pushback from emergency services \u2013 not least as the most common reason for delayed responses is congestion caused by motor vehicles.</p>", "<p>This is the idea that LTNs do not \u201cevaporate\u201d traffic, they merely displace it, and in increasing congestion, they boost overall pollution levels.</p>", "<p>This is a slightly complicated one, as the traffic-evaporation powers of LTNs and similar ideas require two things: a coherent scheme, and time. So yes, simply filtering one or two streets will most likely push rat-runners on to adjoining streets. But that is not an argument against LTNs, just against poorly planned ones.</p>", "<p>Traffic evaporation is well established, particularly if you look at countries like the Netherlands and Denmark, where disincentivising car use on residential roads is an everyday event.</p>", "<p>This is another common objection, and in many ways an understandable one. If you are a business owner already affected by coronavirus, yet more change can seem destabilising. This, however, does not seem to be backed by evidence.</p>", "<p>Lots of studies in various cities have shown that business owners tend to overestimate the proportion of customers who arrive by car, and that they tend to do better when roads are safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p>", "<p>This is all tied in to a gradual change in urban culture, whereby cities compete less on rapid road transport networks, and more on liveability.</p>", "<p>The evidence on this is <a href=\"http://content.tfl.gov.uk/analysis-of-cycling-potential.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">more nuanced than billed</a>, but there are ways in which cycling tends to be skewed towards certain demographics. Some appear to be cultural \u2013 for example <a href=\"http://content.tfl.gov.uk/analysis-of-cycling-potential.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">an analysis</a> on cycling in London indicates people from Asian backgrounds are particularly unlikely to use bikes.</p>", "<p>But much of it, notably the relative lack of women and older people, appears connected to infrastructure. Without quieter streets with coherent cycling networks, bike use is geared more towards hobbyists and enthusiasts, who do not mind mixing with motor traffic \u2013 and these are more likely to be male, and younger.</p>", "<p>The counter-argument is that this presents the issue back-to-front, such as arguing against a bridge over a fast-flowing river, because the only people currently swimming across are young and hearty. In countries like the Netherlands, cycle use very much reflects the wider population.</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carlton-reid"], "tags": ["Environment,Air pollution,Road safety,Newcastle,Edinburgh,London,Cycling,Pedestrianisation,Cities,Life and style,Scotland,UK news,World news"], "title": ["'I got it wrong.

They generally cause the host tree little harm. The gall-forming process is not fully understood, but it induces the tree to reorganise its cells and channel resources (a \u201cphysiological sink\u201d) according to the chemical blueprint the wasps provide; in other words, the oak becomes a builder on the wasps\u2019 behalf.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The galls are surely one of autumn\u2019s strangest fruits, but today I find the sight of these genetically modified orbs sprouting from the waning leaves oddly reassuring.

Some employ lookouts to warn against the coast guard, or use devices to shield their GPS signal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Fanciulli noticed the effects of trawling as early as the 1980s: the damaged ecosystem was affecting his catch and having an impact on his livelihood. So, along with some other local fishermen and activists from Greenpeace, he blocked a commercial port in Tuscany in protest.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">It was the beginning of a struggle that has made him something of a local celebrity. Fanciulli has destroyed trawling nets with barbed wire. He once stopped a trawler by pretending to be the police.

He also runs a small restaurant at weekends, and sells his catch to the <a href=\"http://www.economiasolidale.net/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Gruppi di Acquisto Solidale</a>, a collective of Italian families buying ethical products.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">It wasn\u2019t enough to stop illegal fishing, however. In 2006, a desperate Tuscan government dropped concrete blocks into the sea in an effort to disrupt the trawlers. Fanciulli says they didn\u2019t work, however, as they were too far apart and the nets simply dragged between them.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">He got permission from Arpa, the agency for environmental protection, to drop an additional 80 blocks at his own expense. Still, however, he wasn\u2019t satisfied, and his thoughts turned to the shipwrecks he\u2019d loved as a boy. \u201cI didn\u2019t just want concrete,\u201d he says. \u201cI was fascinated with beautiful antiquities underwater.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">He began to wonder: what if, instead of dropping concrete blocks into the water, he dropped art?</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">He asked a <a href=\"http://www.studidarte.it/en/the-quarries/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">quarry</a> in nearby Carrara if they could donate two marble blocks that he could use to make sculptures. \u201cThey <a href=\"https://www.lastampa.it/tuttogreen/2012/07/03/news/il-marmo-di-michelagelo-per-salvare-br-il-mare-della-maremma-1.36389564\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">donated</a> 100 instead.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Via word of mouth, contributions from tourists and online crowdfunding, Fanciulli persuaded artists including Giorgio Butini, Massimo Lippi, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Pepper\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Beverly Pepper</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rainews.it/tgr/toscana/video/2019/06/tos-emily-young-scultura-regno-unito-gran-bretagna-italia-toscana-maremma-talamone-arte-ambiente-pesci-specie-marine-fondali-8a3a9561-fc4c-46bf-be3e-15dedd9d95f4.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Emily Young</a> to carve sculptures from the marble.

Talamone is a turtle recovery centre \u2013 part of the <a href=\"http://www.tartalife.eu/it\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Tartalife project</a> \u2013 and more turtles have been seen, as have dolphins. \u201cIn the past it was unusual to see dolphins near the coast,\u201d Faniculli says. \u201cThey normally stay offshore, but as industrial fishing destroyed the seabed, they moved close to the statues because, due the repopulation, there is food.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The museum is Fanciulli\u2019s version of the shipwrecks he loved as a boy, and he hopes to build on its success. \u201cWe put in the first statues in 2007 but our goal is to reach 100,\u201d he says, sensing an opportunity. \u201cWe\u2019d like someone to help our battle in defence of the sea.

But they remind me of those rather insidious liquid shapes performed by strangler figs when they surge in slow motion to engulf their arboreal host.</p>", "<p>Richard Williamson notes in The Great Yew Forest how the \u201cwood of the yew stems seems more fluid than others\u201d, and flows around obstacles to envelop them. This pliability partly explains the yew\u2019s legendary status in longbow manufacture, but it goes hand in glove with its almost steel-like strength. In fact, it is claimed that if a yew stake were rammed in the ground with an iron pole, it would last longer. The oldest wooden haft on a human instrument is of yew and thought to be 250,000 years old. Old yews also grow about as slowly as iron: one tree in Crowhurst, Surrey, was said to have put just nine inches on the waist over 250 years.</p>", "<p>Derbyshire yews achieve another impressive feat by growing directly out of pure rock. My favourite is in Chee Dale. It thrusts out of a cleft that\u2019s 10 metres high in the canyon wall, where a thrush must have once perched to eject a yew seed about a century ago. Then the bird flew off, leaving its turd to make its own luck. In the interval a yew has sent out a witch\u2019s broom of iron-grey roots, but here they spread into vertiginous thin air. Overhead, it has clambered across the cliff to create a glorious circle of emerald. Strange, perhaps, but I think of the plant as a kind of hero: of its life of slow growth until it flourishes as this magnificent coat of arms to photosynthesis \u2013 yet its every day passed on the very edge of oblivion.</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/eleanor-ainge-roy"], "tags": ["Recycling,New Zealand,Landfill,Environment,Waste"], "title": ["Gold star for you: New Zealand council puts stickers on bins of best recyclers"], "date": ["2020-11-17T02:50:49.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p>Recycling rates soar in Christchurch after council rewards the best households and confiscates bins of laggards</p>", "<p class=\"css-vdb1rb\">Last modified on Tue 17 Nov 2020 02.56 GMT</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A recycling scheme in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">New Zealand</a> modelled on rewards familiar to kindergarten children has seen tonnes of additional recycling head to the sorters every week, instead of landfill.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Following the coronavirus lockdown in March and April, Christchurch city council saw recycling rates plummet, with material from only 48% of recycling trucks able to be processed in June due to frequent contamination issues, the result of poor sorting by residents.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Ross Trotter, the council\u2019s manager for resource and recovery, said his team decided to introduce a public reward and shaming system to motivate people to recycle more carefully.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">New Zealanders have low rates of recycling compared with other countries and the amount of waste sent to landfills is expected to double in the next 10 years in Auckland alone, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/recycling\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Recycling</a> New Zealand.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The Christchurch scheme involves placing a large gold star on the kerbside wheelie bins of successful recyclers, and removes the bins of those who repeatedly fail to recycle properly.

It was the SSI\u2019s findings on reduced antibody efficacy that led to the cull order. M\u00f8lbak told local media he is retiring because he is 65 and denied it was related to the mink cull.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Until now there had been no widespread reports of mink variants in humans outside Denmark. But scientists uploading virus sequencing and variant <a href=\"https://www.gisaid.org/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">information to Gisaid</a>, a global database initiative, said there have been signs of the mink variants around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWe knew there were these mink variants in seven countries, but we only had about 20 genomes of each, which is very few. Then last week the Danes uploaded 6,000 genome sequences and with those we were able to identify 300 or more of the mink variant Y453F in viruses having infected humans in Denmark,\u201d said University College London (UCL) Genetics Institute director Francois Balloux.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Asked about the implications of the findings, Balloux said it was an indication of the need to cull farmed mink. \u201cA bigger host reservoir means more infections in humans. The main point here, I think, is that although the mutation might not be scary, there is still very good reason to get rid of the mink reservoir. We just don\u2019t need it.\u201d In Denmark, he added, they have a lot of mink, \u201cover three times more than humans\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The prevalence of Danish mink-related mutations is evident in the Gisaid database. \u201cDenmark has 329 F-variant sequences, which roughly maps to as many individuals, although there may be some duplicates,\u201d said Prof Seshadri Vasan, who leads the dangerous pathogens team at Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation <a href=\"https://www.csiro.au/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">(CSIRO)</a> and analysed the database for the mink variants. \u201cThe Netherlands has six. South Africa and Switzerland have two each, while the Faroe Islands, Russia and Utah [US] have one each.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Asked how the spread might have happened, Vasan said that given some of the human and mink F-variants were from samples collected in Denmark in June, it might be that \u201cmovement of people, animals or goods could have spread the F-variant to other countries\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But, because the Gisaid database includes only patchy patient information and no travel history \u2013 and as some of the samples lack collection dates \u2013 he said it is impossible to say exactly how and when the spread took place, although local scientists might be better placed to understand.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Last month, Vasan and his team <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tbed.13892\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">published</a> a global template aimed at improving the collection and sharing of de-identified patient information in a bid to improve data quality.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Viruses are known to mutate, but variants alone are not necessarily a problem. Most importantly, said Prof Joanne Santini, a microbiologist at UCL, we still don\u2019t know whether this mutation happened in mink or humans first.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In a joint email this week to the Guardian, Santini and UCL colleague Prof Sarah Edwards, a bioethicist, said the Sars-CoV-2 Y453F variant in the spike protein is \u201cunlikely to pose any serious risk to the expected efficacy of current candidate vaccines, or itself pose a new public health threat\u201d on its own.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">If, however, the variant originated in mink and spread to humans, \u201cthen we would have to doubt our ability to manage outbreaks in otherwise seemingly contained farm animals once detected\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Constant mutations could be a source of concern too. The email added that \u201cmultiple additional variants in the spike protein could indeed have concerning implications for how infectious the virus is to humans and also to animals\u201d, potentially posing \u201cnew threats to the expected efficacy of our candidate vaccines\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe early observations by <a href=\"https://www.csiro.au/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">CSIRO</a> scientists demonstrate the possible implications for the wider spread of Sars-CoV-2 variants between humans and animals,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Although Denmark is the only country to order a nationwide mink cull, others, including the Netherlands, Spain and, most recently, Greece, are killing mink with Covid-19.

Charley Grimston, the chief executive of Altelium, which makes software for electric vehicles, said: \u201c\u00a3500m for mass-scale production of batteries does not compare to investment in countries such as Germany, where figures are in the billions for new battery manufacturing plants.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">For some of the items on the 10-point list, public funding will play only a minor role. Offshore wind companies, for instance, are expected to invest tens of billions in building new windfarms. Offshore wind is mature technology, and companies need only the right system of energy regulation to reassure them they can turn a profit and spur them to invest.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Car manufacturers are expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/18/uk-ban-on-new-fossil-fuel-vehicles-by-2030-not-enough-to-hit-climate-targets\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">take the lead on electric vehicles</a>, investing in new plant and training the workforce, and North Sea oil and gas companies are regarded as well placed to move into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/03/green-hydrogen-from-renewables-could-become-cheapest-transformative-fuel-within-a-decade?\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">hydrogen fuel</a> and carbon capture and storage technology.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This means the \u00a312bn from taxpayers will be only a start, and would be quickly outweighed by private-sector investment. Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, pointed out on Twitter: \u201cPrivate offshore wind investment alone would dwarf the \u00a312bn \u2026 Majority will be private investment, with some public investment alongside.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, which plans to invest \u00a310bn in green projects in the UK, said the government did not need to spend more taxpayer money to reach its goals, if it set up the right investment frameworks to galvanise private capital.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cI don\u2019t think the government needs to spend huge amounts of taxpayer money,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIf we have proper policy framework and investment frameworks then money will flow into the system quite readily. Take the offshore wind sector, for example: the government stated an ambition, set up its [contracts for difference] mechanism, and this has created a self-perpetuating industrial success story. We are starting to see the same thing in electric vehicles where costs are beginning to come down.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">There is a catch, however: currently, the cost of greening the power sector has been met by additions to electricity bills, which can be controversial and which hit the poorest hardest. The UK\u2019s only new nuclear power plant under construction, Hinkley Point C, was agreed under a deal with the French company EDF that will require billpayers to pay more than \u00a390 per megawatt hour for 35 years, estimated to put as much as \u00a318 on each household\u2019s bill per year.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">If the government is to avoid loading future costs on to bills, a more equitable way will need to be found. The prime minister has hinted at carbon pricing, but who would pay and how such a system would be managed has yet to be set out.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Another problem is that for many of the projects, there is no clear way to encourage private-sector investment. For instance, redesigning towns and cities to encourage cycling and walking is likely to fall to local authorities, but the sums so far made available to them are not close to enough for the large-scale transformation required.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Restoring nature and planting trees will also be costly, and is likely to have to come from the public purse, some of it in the form of subsidies to farmers. Hilary McGrady, the director general of the National Trust, welcomed the government\u2019s promise of \u00a380m for a nature recovery fund, but added: \u201cWe know that billions are needed to restore nature and make the sort of impact that\u2019s required to tackle climate change. We will need long-term commitments of reliable funding, including through the new agricultural system, and further deeper commitments to achieve the goals set out in the government\u2019s 25-year plan for the environment.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Public-sector investment is not just a cost. Using energy more efficiently will be a saving, and moving to renewable energy will cut fuel costs, while green jobs will be an economic boon.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The benefits will also be felt in improved public health and wellbeing, as well as a safer climate. For instance, the Federation of Master Builders estimates that insulating the UK\u2019s draughty homes will save the NHS at least \u00a32bn a year in preventable illness, and switching to electric vehicles will prevent some of the 40,000 deaths each year from air pollution. The CBI has calculated that 3m working days are lost each year to air pollution at present.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Some experts want the government to put in place longer-term mechanisms that will mean that new low-carbon technologies pay for themselves over time. Myles Allen, a professor of geosystem science at Oxford University, said: \u201cThe prime minister doesn\u2019t say who is going to pay for carbon capture in the long term. It\u2019s fine to use public money to get it going, but it\u2019s not fair on taxpayers to spend all that without a clear business model for the private sector to take over.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThere is a really simple solution \u2013 called a carbon takeback obligation \u2013 which would spread the cost over the entire fossil fuel industry and its customers, keeping it manageable and fair. Bring this in and net zero by 2050 really does start to look within reach.\u201d</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["Hannah Chinn"], "tags": ["Coral,Public lands,Marine life,Environment,Oceans"], "title": ["'Dire outlook': scientists say Florida reefs have lost nearly 98% of coral"], "date": ["2020-11-18T10:00:39.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p>The United States\u2019 coral reefs are in fair condition, according to a recent reef condition status report, but vulnerable to decline.

Muller says Florida\u2019s reef is estimated to be worth at least $8bn to the state economy, providing support for over 70,000 local jobs; a <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2019/1027/ofr20191027.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">recent US Geological Survey report</a> estimated that coral reefs provide almost $600m in infrastructure to the peninsula and over $75m to the Florida Keys every year.</p>", "<p>In response to the threat of potential future decline, scientists are working to raise awareness and restore coral growth. Past efforts to replant coral reefs have been utilized in response to acute damage like a ship strike or a storm \u2013 now, researchers are using the same knowledge to help reverse the effect climate change has had on reef populations.</p>", "<p>\u201cIf for whatever reason a forest is clearcut,\u201d Koss says, referring to the practice by which trees are cut down or removed, \u201cor it\u2019s damaged by a fire or a tornado, nobody thinks twice about going back and replanting what was there.

It has a putrid smell that reveals what the Murcia government has described as a \u201cgrave ecological unbalance\u201d, and what activists are calling \u201cecocide\u201d: a crime against an ecosystem and the species \u2013 including humans \u2013 that live within it.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In 2016, an extreme eutrophication \u2013 a massive growth of algae caused by a discharge of nutrients, mainly from agriculture \u2013 turned the water here green and killed <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Seabed-evolution-of-the-Mar-Menor-from-2014-to-2016-and-main-seagrass-species-of-the_fig2_325302595\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">85% of the seagrass</a>. Thousands of fish were beached on the shore, unable to breathe because of a lack of oxygen resulting from the degradation of excessive algae and changes to salinity.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The lagoon stank. House prices plummeted, tourist numbers fell and the economy suffered. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Now local people are furious. Experts point the finger at the agriculture industry \u2013 exporting mostly vegetables to European countries such as the UK, Germany and France \u2013 as the main polluter. The problem is nitrates from the intensive irrigation of crops, as well as poor sewage systems in towns surrounding the lagoon, which have grown dramatically since the 1960s, and discharge from mining activities. More than two decades of lax regulations have not helped.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWith our model of development we broke the ecological balance,\u201d says Teresa Vicente Gim\u00e9nez, 58, a professor of philosophy of law at Murcia University, who has put her weight behind a new idea \u2013 to grant legal rights to the Mar Menor by recognising it as a legal \u201cperson\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThey would say in our legal system there is no space [for protecting the rights of an ecosystem]\u201d, she says. \u201cSo we have created a new model of justice.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The ambitious proposal recognises the right of the lagoon to \u201cexist as an ecosystem\u201d and to be protected and preserved by the government and residents. If the proposal is approved, the lagoon would be represented by three groups: legal guardians, a monitoring committee of \u201cprotectors\u201d, and a scientific advisory board. Moreover, any citizen or legal entity would be able to file a lawsuit on behalf of the Mar Menor.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This model is not entirely new: countries including New Zealand, Ecuador and India are home to bodies of water or ecosystems that have been granted legal privileges. In Colombia in 2016 the constitutional court recognised the Atrato River as a legal entity. The ministry of environment and sustainable development became its legal guardian and a commission of \u201cprotectors\u201d was established to look after the river.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Perhaps the case most similar to the Mar Menor is that of Lake Erie, one of the Great Lakes that straddles the US-Canada border. Like the Mar Menor, Lake Erie was polluted by fertilisers from agriculture. In 2019, after a referendum of the citizens of Toledo, Ohio, the lake was granted the status of a legal entity.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">For a few hours at least, citizens could file lawsuits on behalf of the lake without depending on state government or regulatory agencies \u2013 but the breakthrough was short-lived. An agribusiness company sued the city the following day, freezing the \u201clegal person\u201d law. Last February, a federal judge declared it unconstitutional.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Nevertheless, Vicente Gim\u00e9nez was inspired to follow the same path after returning from Reading University in 2018, where she had been studying attempts in other countries to grant rights to nature. Her students proposed their own study about the legal rights of the Mar Menor. \u201cThen they said, \u2018Professor, why don\u2019t we publish this in a newspaper so the people know this is possible?\u2019\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The idea was picked up by local newspaper La Opini\u00f3n de Murcia, in which Vicente Gim\u00e9nez wrote a piece arguing that the most feasible way to give rights to the lagoon was by a \u201cpopular legislative initiative\u201d, which allows citizens to propose a law.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Backed by NGOs that campaign for the preservation of the Mar Menor, Vicente Gim\u00e9nez presented the initiative in the Spanish parliament in July. Now Vicente Gim\u00e9nez and other activists from diverse professional backgrounds are preparing for the near impossible. They have nine months to gather half a million signatures in order for the initiative to be voted on in parliament.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cI hope they can help us with the Mar Menor, and we can recover all of it, not only the lagoon,\u201d says Nicolas Lozano S\u00e1nchez, 34, who owns a restaurant in the town of Los Alc\u00e1zares, now home to hundreds of fluttering black flags with the emblem of the seahorse \u2013 the creature for which the Mar Menor is well known. \u201cThe lagoon is our economy.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Los Alc\u00e1zares has seen some of the biggest algae blooms. This year the water is clearer, but the underlying problems still exist. Over the summer chemical engineer Laura G\u00f3mez went out with a diving team to test whether the water was safe for residents. Based on her results, the town hall has banned swimming in some areas.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201c[The pollution] is worsening because no measures have been taken,\u201d G\u00f3mez says. \u201cWe are all responsible for this, all of society, the intensive agriculture, the exploitation for tourism, and everyone who throws rubbish into the lagoon.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But she is sceptical about the plan to grant rights to Mar Menor. \u201cPaper alone is cheap,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need action more than words, like controlling where the waste goes from the rain or the treatment plants. All that rainwater [is] dragging nitrates from the crops.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Vicente Gim\u00e9nez knows there are difficulties ahead. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Los Alc\u00e1zares council, which has otherwise supported the people\u2019s initiative, has also produced a report from its own legal expert declaring that giving the lagoon independent governance might be unconstitutional, or overlap with previous environmental legislation designed to protect it.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Nevertheless, Vicente Gim\u00e9nez is undeterred. \u201cWe can tell our children we fought until the end,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we succeed, we go to parliament, we discuss it there.

But he said it wasn\u2019t just the fence that would improve the park.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe fence is the iconic bit, but it\u2019s the management following it that\u2019s really important.

What it does is then open the door to re-wilding animals and readjusting the ecology.\u201d</p>", "<p>The Victorian environment minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, said the funding boost would help protect the environment and make it easier for more people to enjoy the park.</p>", "<p>\u201cThese are vital investments in conservation that will not only protect the biodiversity that underpins the health of Victoria\u2019s environment but also take carbon out of our atmosphere, an important step in fighting climate change.\u201d</p>", "<p>Norman told Guardian Australia the funding would go toward improving the walking track, making the facilities safe and more accessible, as well as replacing old \u201cglamping\u201d spots with eco-friendly pods.</p>", "<p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll engage the public and it\u2019ll be a model for getting more people active in nature conservation and connecting with nature.\u201d</p>", "<p>Ruchel welcomed the upgrades to visitor facilities, saying they are much needed in this current climate.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe know people are more inspired to visit nature, and we saw it after the first lockdown that there was an explosion in visitation, so the visitation needs to be managed.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cThe infrastructure helps with that, but we shouldn\u2019t forget we need core ecological programs to make sure it\u2019s not just the physical assets that are protected, but also that we\u2019re managing the parks to the highest level.\u201d</p>", "<p>Authorities are hoping that by preventing predators and pests entering the park, they will be able to reintroduce native animals, such as the eastern bristlebird, eastern bettong and the spot-tailed quoll.</p>", "<p>\u201cBy getting rid of the feral pests, we\u2019ll see an amazing bounce-back in endangered birds, endangered ground mammals, their reptiles and frogs. One feral cat can eat up to 5,000 animals a year, so they\u2019re just pigging out on animals wholesale.\u201d</p>", "<p>Ruchel said he was happy with the funding, and thought it was enough to get the upgrades installled and implemented, but that it wasn\u2019t enough.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see the Andrews government recognising the value of our natural areas by making this investment, but in the longer term we need better routine funding for management.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cThe problem we have in park management is if its initial funding, it doesn\u2019t always last. There is a question of needing ongoing long term support for these programs so that our ecosystems are managed consistently and for the long term.\u201d</p>", "<p>Norman hoped the park could act as an emergency shelter for threatened species around the state, especially after last year\u2019s bushfires.</p>", "<p>\u201cIn the bushfires, we almost lost the Victorian eastern bristlebird, and we\u2019re going to set up an insurance population at the Prom, so if another catastrophic fire comes, they don\u2019t go extinct in the state.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cThe improvements will really come to show off the jewel in Victoria\u2019s natural estate.\u201d</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/philgates"], "tags": ["Gardens,Environment,Rural affairs,UK news,Life and style,Wild flowers"], "title": ["Country diary: a creaky greenhouse makes a snug shelter from the downpour"], "date": ["2020-11-18T05:30:33.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p><strong>Crook, County Durham:</strong> There\u2019s a pleasant aroma of damp earth, and some wildflower seedlings are sprouting</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><span class=\"css-17ehqsd\"><span class=\"css-1ljoi60\">D</span></span><span class=\"css-38z03z\">uring a break in the rain, I dashed down to the greenhouse at the bottom of the garden.

Two of the dark-coloured fry are seen here (<strong>2</strong>) forcefully being expelled from his brood pouch. With adults measuring less than 2cm in length, the fry are just 2-3mm long.

I recorded the transition of a juvenile pygmy seahorse and it took five days to become a perfect match with the gorgonian.</p>", "<p><strong>3. </strong><strong> </strong>Tom holds open his brood pouch with one last baby still remaining. <strong>4. </strong>Tom seen with his wrinkled, now empty, brood pouch</p>", "<p>After all the babies have finally been released, the male pygmy seahorse is perhaps the only male in the animal kingdom to truly suffer from stretch marks. His empty brood pouch was now wrinkled (<strong>4</strong>) following the birth of the fry he had been carrying. Although he was clearly quite exhausted, Tom immediately headed back to where Josephine was resting. There wasn\u2019t a moment\u2019s respite for him, as Josephine quickly emerged and began a series of ritualised quivers to convey her intention to proceed to the next part of the reproductive cycle.</p>", "<p><strong>5. </strong>Just 20 minutes after giving birth, Tom\u2019s tail is entwined with Josephine\u2019s. <strong>6.</strong> Josephine pushes more unfertilised eggs across to Tom\u2019s empty brood pouch</p>", "<p>After a series of ritualised dances, Tom and Josephine both released their grip of the gorgonian coral and their tails intertwined <strong>(5)</strong>. Tom was still very deflated after having given birth 20 minutes or so before. Josephine, on the left, is clearly rather plump because she is full of a clutch of unfertilised eggs. Females begin to hydrate their clutch a few days before mating. The daily courtship rituals are carried out to help synchronise the pair\u2019s reproductive cycles. It is important the female doesn\u2019t begin to prepare the eggs for mating too early as they may spoil if the male is not ready.</p>", "<p>It took 45 seconds for Josephine to push the unfertilised eggs across to Tom\u2019s empty brood pouch (<strong>6</strong>). As they entered his reproductive system he fertilised them. The sequence allowed Tom to be certain that each and every baby he would carry would be his own. This certainty of paternity is extremely rare in the animal kingdom, and explains why male seahorses put so much effort into raising their offspring. It was an honour to be the first person to witness and record this series of events.</p>", "<p><strong>7. </strong>A gorgonian seafan</p>", "<p>Bargibant\u2019s and Denise\u2019s pygmy seahorses live exclusively on the surface of gorgonian seafans (<strong>7</strong>). These seahorses are very hard to find because of their miniature size and fantastic camouflage, so knowing which species of gorgonians they live on is a huge help. Gorgonians are fan-like corals that can get as large as a car\u2019s windscreen. They attach to the reef where ocean currents hit, bringing large volumes of nutrients. They are covered in polyps that trap plankton for food. These are animals, not plants, so don\u2019t need sunlight for energy.</p>", "<p><strong>8.</strong> The Japanese pygmy seahorse, <em>Hippocampus japapigu</em></p>", "<p>In 2013 I was in Okinawa in Japan to attend a conference. Years before, I had seen a picture of an unusual pygmy seahorse taken in Japan that piqued my interest. After hours trawling the internet, I tracked down a location where I thought I might find it and headed to the small island of Hachij\u014d-jima, south of Tokyo. Amazingly, over the course of a few days I managed to find more than a dozen of them (<strong>8</strong>) and was sure they were distinct from all others I had seen before.</p>", "<p>It wasn\u2019t until I was presenting at another conference a few years later that things started moving forwards. During my keynote presentation, I mentioned these pygmy seahorses and that I was sure they were a new species. Graham Short, an expert in seahorse taxonomy, came and spoke to me, which immediately began a flurry of seahorse excitement. Eighteen months later, we named the new 2cm-long pygmy seahorse <em>Hippocampus japapigu </em><strong>(9)</strong>. At the time, it was thought to only occur in the waters off Japan, but it has since been confirmed as far south as Taiwan.</p>", "<p><strong>9. </strong>The Japanese pygmy seahorse has also been found off the coast of Taiwan. <strong>10. </strong>The South African pygmy seahorse, <em>Hippocampus nalu</em>, was recognised as a new species in May</p>", "<p>In May of this year, colleagues from the International Union for Conservation of Nature and I named a new species of pygmy seahorse, <em>Hippocampus nalu </em>(<strong>10</strong>). A few months earlier, a dive guide had spotted it in Sodwana Bay, in north-eastern South Africa. I went with a colleague to observe it first hand. It is the first pygmy seahorse to have been recorded anywhere in the Indian Ocean. The waters off South Africa are quite wild, and it wasn\u2019t easy to find and photograph them as each surge wave dragged me several metres away from the subject.</p>", "<p><strong>11.</strong> A pygmy pipehorse, a close relative of the seahorse, found off the coast of New Zealand</p>", "<p>Several years ago a diver came across a strange fish and assumed it was New Zealand\u2019s first indigenous seahorse. It was, in fact, a new species of pygmy pipehorse (<strong>11</strong>), a very close relative of the seahorse. I managed to capture one of the only images of this species in the wild in 2017. At that time, it hadn\u2019t been seen in over six months. The pipehorse is only 5-6cm long with immaculate camouflage. I found a pair clinging to a tiny algal frond.</p>", "<p><strong>12.</strong> A \u2018velvet\u2019 ghost pipefish</p>", "<p>An undescribed species of ghost pipefish, commonly known as the velvetghost pipefish (<strong>12</strong>), tends to live around brightly coloured sponges, and each individual pipefish matches exactly the colour of the sponge immediately adjacent to where it lives. There are half a dozen or so other ghost pipefishes found across the Indo-Pacific oceans, and each is highly adapted for its habitat. Some are white, others pink or even scarlet. They usually live in male-female pairs that hunt tiny shrimps and other crustaceans.</p>", "<p><strong>13.</strong> A thread pipehorse, <em>Kyonemichthys rumengani</em></p>", "<p>Since the turn of the millennium there has been a flurry of discoveries of miniature fishes. I believe this is because the megafauna \u2013 such as sharks, turtles and rays \u2013 around south-east Asia have dwindled to such an extent that recreational divers and their guides began to look at smaller creatures to satisfy their curiosity. This thread pipehorse, <em>Kyonemichthys rumengani </em>(<strong>13</strong>), was described in 2007. It is just 2.6cm long and looks like several intertwined hairs moving around. Just like seahorses, these fish brood their young in a pouch on the male\u2019s belly.</p>", "<p><strong>14.</strong> A Lynne\u2019s pipefish, <em>Festucalex rufus</em>, which is the size of a cocktail stick</p>", "<p>Lynne\u2019s pipefish, <em>Festucalex rufus </em>(<strong>14</strong>), was only named in 2015. Again, it evaded detection owing to its small size, habitat specificity and highly efficient camouflage. It is the size of a cocktail stick and lives only among little patches of a certain sponge found on coral reef walls below around 15 metres depth. It matches the sponge exactly in texture and colour, and even when you\u2019re looking directly at one, it\u2019s almost impossible to see it.</p>", "<p><strong>15.</strong> A Walea soft coral pygmy seahorse, <em>Hippocampus waleananus</em>, found in Indonesia</p>", "<p>Two risk factors for a species\u2019 chance of extinction are their habitat specificity and geographic range. This pygmy seahorse (<strong>15</strong>) was named in 2009 as the Walea soft coral pygmy seahorse, <em>Hippocampus waleananus</em>. In the year before it was described, I observed it in the wild and am one of the few to have done so. It is only found in one small bay in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, where it lives only on the surface of certain soft corals. There has never been any research on their biology but the relative risks to their populations are great.</p>", "<p><strong>16.</strong> A Pontoh\u2019s pygmy seahorse, <em>Hippocampus pontohi</em></p>", "<p>Just one species of pygmy seahorse was known before the turn of the millennium. Since then, another seven have been added to the list. I took this image of Pontoh\u2019s pygmy seahorse, <em>Hippocampus pontohi</em> (<strong>16</strong>), which was named in 2008, in February this year in Indonesia. The dark-coloured Pontoh\u2019s were originally described as a distinct species, but genetic analysis has shown that they are the same as the white form. Seahorses are extremely variable in colour and surface texture, which has led to many new species being erroneously named over the years.</p>", "<p><strong>17.</strong> Genetic analysis shows the Japanese pygmy seahorse split from all others around 8 million years ago</p>", "<p>The Japanese pygmy seahorse (<strong>17</strong>) appears superficially similar to several others, but genetic analysis shows it split from all others around 8 million years ago. It has a few morphological differences, too, which allow the trained eye to identify it. Unlike Bargibant\u2019s and Denise\u2019s pygmies, which live on the surface of gorgonian corals, I found the Japanese species grasping to the algal tufts that cover the huge volcanic boulders found around Hachij\u014d-jima. Because of this, it is much harder to find them. The large swells off Hachij\u014d mean it\u2019s difficult to stay still enough in the water to keep an eye on them.</p>", "<p><strong>18.</strong> A rare, pristine coral reef, in West Papua, Indonesia</p>", "<p>Sadly, pristine coral reefs like this one in West Papua, Indonesia (<strong>18</strong>), are becoming much harder to find. One of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/04/coral-reef-bleaching-the-new-normal-and-a-fatal-threat-to-ecosystems\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">greatest threats comes from coral bleaching</a>. When the water around coral reefs is 2C above the average for the time of year, the symbiotic algae within the coral\u2019s cells become stressed and leave. The algae contain photosynthetic pigments that provide energy to the coral. In exchange, the coral provides the algae with its own waste products, which act as a fertiliser. Without the algae, coral is left ghostly white. Some researchers believe coral reefs in their current form may not survive beyond 2050. That, in turn, means the pygmy seahorse faces an uncertain future.</p>", "<p><em><a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-world-beneath/richard-smith/9781948062220\" data-link-name=\"in body

What was neglected is that animal welfare and human welfare, far from advancing at cross-purposes, are actually integrally connected. The decades-long transition to concentrated animal feeding operations [CAFOs] lays bare this connection, and the consequences of its breach, with startling clarity.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Wilkinson described a system in which pigs were forced to live in enclosures they had outgrown, reducing them \u201cto almost suffocating closeness \u2026 The dangers endemic to such appalling conditions always manifested first in animal suffering.

Juries in 2018 and 2019 had awarded hog farm neighbors almost $550m. The US district court in Raleigh, North Carolina, knocked the awards down to about $98m because of a state law capping punitive damages.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Smithfield\u2019s chief administrative officer, Keira Lombardo, said in a statement: \u201cIn the midst of a global pandemic, where food shortages have been commonplace, it is now the time to keep our full attention on the important work of producing good food in a responsible and sustainable way \u2013 rather than returning to the court for what would be ongoing and distracting litigation.\u201d Details of the settlement were not disclosed.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Smithfield lost the first five cases that went to trial.

The appellate ruling said jurors should not have heard those details. \u201cWe fail to see what value the parent company financial evidence would have that could possibly outweigh the substantial risk of prejudice it carries in that delicate context,\u201d wrote Thacker.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Elsie Herring, a plaintiff in another of the cases, said she was pleased that the court had sided with the neighbors on most issues. \u201cOur lives have been destroyed by the industry,\u201d she said.

Current commitments, made in 2015, would lead to 3C of heating, which scientists say would have catastrophic consequences.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In recent weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/22/china-pledges-to-reach-carbon-neutrality-before-2060\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">China</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/26/japan-will-become-carbon-neutral-by-2050-pm-pledges\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Japan</a> have presented pledges to reach net\u2013zero emissions by mid century.

The climate ambition summit will take place on 12 December, the fifth anniversary of the forging of the Paris agreement.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The virtual meeting of world leaders is seen as a critical milestone on the way to Cop26, the UN climate summit that was scheduled to start last week but, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/we-must-use-this-time-well-climate-experts-hopeful-after-cop26-delay-coronavirus\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">to be held next November in Glasgow</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Countries are supposed to submit their NDCs by the end of this year, so the UN and scientific experts will have time to examine them in detail before Cop26.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">However, the UK is likely to run very close to its own deadline of the 12 December summit. That is because the committee on climate change \u2013 the government\u2019s statutory advisers \u2013 will make its report on a sixth carbon budget, for the period 2033 to 2037, on 9 December.

It was quiet, you could hear birds singing, and neighbours were having a chat for the first time. Before, you couldn\u2019t hear each other over the road because of the noise of the busy traffic, and wouldn\u2019t just pop over and leave the kids. Now we\u2019ve all become really good friends,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThere\u2019s an older lady who lives on our road, and her bike got stolen. We all put in a tenner and bought her a new one. That wouldn\u2019t have happened before.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cPeople are changing their behaviours already, like walking, picking up their children rather than driving,\u201d she added. \u201cIf more people cycle and walk, there will be less traffic. I have to drive sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t add much time to my journey, and that sacrifice is worth it to feel safer on the road and have that community spirit.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">However, not everyone living under an LTN has found the transformation a positive one.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Daniel, 33, lives on a main road leading to the South Circular in London\u2019s Hither Green, where an LTN was introduced soon after the first national lockdown in March. He felt that the measures deepened divide between wealthier and poorer residents, increasing pollution for those living near main roads.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe LTN measures have moved traffic away from the Manor House side of Hither Green where a three-bedroom house costs \u00a31m, to the poorer side nearer Catford, where we live,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe traffic leading on to the South Circular is now gridlocked every day and created a massive bottleneck. The streets under the LTN are really nice, but they\u2019ve just pushed it all towards Catford,,\u201d he added.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Daniel said he supported a greening of his local area, but felt it should be approached differently. He suggested the council focus on incentivising people to take public transport, or increasing opportunities for charging electric cars.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWe all want a greener London but this is no way to go about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want fewer car journeys overall, then residents need more incentives and less punishment. More carrot, less stick.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Daniel\u2019s concerns were echoed by others who contacted the Guardian via a call out. One of those was 35-year-old engineer Yacob Ahmed, who lives on the edge of Hyde Park in Leeds where an LTN was implemented in early November. His opposition to the scheme centred largely on the impact on the business community.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to businesses who are very concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cThe postmaster has said if it keeps impacting him, he\u2019ll have to close up. Deliveries and suppliers are being affected, with couriers getting lost and lorries unable to drop off supplies because the road blocks are taking up parking spaces.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">According to Ahmed, the measures didn\u2019t make the streets safer.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt\u2019s not safer if cars and lorries are stuck, and having to reverse back out on to the main roads, and in areas without cars going up and down, they\u2019ve effectively created mugging hotspots,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWe care about the environment too, we care about air quality too,\u201d he added. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the landscape of Hyde Park is compatible with such a scheme.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"> But other readers, who were initially opposed, found that living with less traffic and more peace eventually changed their minds. Emily Holman, a 33-year-old commercial manager in football who lives in Sydenham, south London, initially opposed the introduction of the LTN on her road in late June, but said her concerns were mainly about the lack of communication.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt was a shock,\u201d she said. \u201cSome flower planters just arrived one day, and then they put the bollard up. I would have expected to get a note or letter through the door, and it would have been great to get consultation.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Since the LTN was introduced, Holman has changed her views, and hopes it will remain in place after the trial period.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt is an inconvenience from a driving point of view, but from a resident\u2019s point of view I prefer it,\u201d Holman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived in the flat for six years, and have seen a number of car crashes and bumps. With the road closed, that\u2019s stopped.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIf they\u2019d educated people about the fact that they were doing it to improve air quality, there would have been a better reception,\u201d she added.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">One 45-year-old resident, who preferred not to be named, praised the handling of the issue by her local councillors in West Greenwich, who she said have been engaging with residents for nearly four years. She said that before the six-month trial of the LTN, the councillors held workshops and meetings, open engagement events for people to assess the plans, and conducted a survey with 900 people, modifying the scheme according to their feedback.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Before the LTN was introduced in late August, she described her street as \u201chideous\u201d with pets hit by vehicles, near misses involving children and arguments over log-jammed traffic.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">While she said the scheme had been \u201ccontroversial\u201d, on her road the positive changes since the introduction of the LTN had been immediate.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cYou can see children on their bikes, and my neighbour who has lived here for 40 years said he\u2019d seen children playing hopscotch in the street for the first time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the old days.

A good start would be getting a group together and attending local councillors\u2019 surgeries on a rota basis.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Be honest about the downsides of LTNs, and that short trips in the car will become less convenient. \u201cAlmost all LTNs will cause some opposition,\u201d says Munk, \u201cand if your council isn\u2019t willing to face that opposition don\u2019t bother \u2013 instead spend time getting political will because otherwise it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Make sure the council promises to listen. This month Leeds announced its first new trial LTNs (the city, like many around the UK, has <a href=\"https://mindthezag.com/places/smashing-the-tyranny-of-the-status-quo-10-of-britains-historic-hidden-gem-ltns/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">historic LTNs</a>) in November.

People living in LTNs talk about hearing more birds, a stronger sense of community, and the pleasure of seeing young people on bicycles on roads which are much safer.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">They can be great for business too, with people spending more time in their local area.

They\u2019ve taken ownership.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Sarah Berry campaigned to support her local LTN in south London, after she started enjoying the quieter roads. She was also behind the now widely used \u201croad open\u201d signs. She says: \u201cOnce those fears get established, people get too scared to say they like the LTNs because they don\u2019t want to get into a fight with their neighbour or fear they\u2019ll become a target of campaigns to switch them to the other side. No one wants to have to deal with that in their community.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWe helped create a space where celebrating the changes and speaking about the benefits was something people felt encouraged and allowed to do.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt\u2019s easy just to think that the people who think differently don\u2019t care about your kids,\u201d says Addy. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re at that point, you\u2019re just going to reach a total impasse, and things will escalate. Typically, what that then results in is a consultation where people are just entrenched. It\u2019s much easier to paint a bleak picture than a wonderful picture, and people are much more likely to respond to a consultation negatively than positively if that\u2019s the kind of vibe. That comes from people not understanding each other, and not wanting to have that conversation.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Information sharing is important, says Berry. An equalities impact analysis on the local consultation website showed that no groups were disadvantaged by the LTN, which Berry\u2019s campaign shared. \u201cIt totally destroyed the arguments of those opposed.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">For her it\u2019s also about a community taking ownership of the space. Her campaign talked to local businesses and added benches to planters outside a couple of shops in response, for shopkeepers or their customers to sit on. Residents even decorated the planters for Halloween.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">She says: \u201cThere was a woman here who, all her friends were opposed, and she was too, and she got involved in greening the street, and now she\u2019s one of the most vocal advocates, not because someone told her \u2018you\u2019re wrong\u2019 but because she got to use her street in the best way.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Simon Still, from Lambeth Cycling Campaign, says: \u201cThere\u2019s been a fair bit of shouting in the streets and online abuse, \u2018we know where you live\u2019-type messages.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt\u2019s funny minor restrictions on people\u2019s ability to drive brings out such extreme behaviours. People are very protective about what they see as their right to drive everywhere. For the best part of a century the car has been sold as an enabler of personal freedom, but what a car owner gets takes away a lot of personal freedoms from people who don\u2019t own a car. I suppose what our campaign\u2019s trying to do is reinstate some of those freedoms.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Munk adds: \u201cOne of the great things happening is this whole trial process. People are trying to stop a consultation because they\u2019re scared, but if you don\u2019t like it later down the line, you can pull out.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The government\u2019s emergency active travel fund paid for \u201cexperimental\u201d LTNs on the condition they went in quickly. Although the consultation period running alongside the temporary measures means people can experience the changes before drawing conclusions, it also upset a lot of people.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">As Munk says: \u201cIf there\u2019s been one thing over everything else from the opposition it\u2019s that there has been no consultation.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">According to a chat with one council officer on an LTN scheme in east London, councils have to really stay on top of how the scheme develops. \u201cThat may mean dealing with civil disobedience: if a sign\u2019s painted over, restore it the next day; if a bollard is removed, replace it immediately\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Above all, residents can show support for an LTN. As Sustrans\u2019 Giulio Ferrini says: \u201cAll of these schemes are on a knife-edge. If you like something it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s here to stay.

populations.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The scientists compiled all available data and records of the platypus to examine changes in both its distribution and occurrence, concluding that it meets the criteria for a vulnerable listing under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Conservation</a> Act.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Their research found that since 1990, the amount of platypus habitat in Australia had declined by 199,919 square kilometres \u2013 or 22.6% \u2013 which is an area almost three times the size of Tasmania.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The sharpest declines by state were in NSW and Queensland, which respectively

We are in Latchmore valley near Fordingbridge, where more than a hundred cows and horses have gathered in the cool breeze that tumbles off the surrounding hills, providing respite from biting insects (behaviour known locally as \u201cshading\u201d). It resembles a congregation of animals you might see around a waterhole, except the horses have letters branded on their backs.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The ponies are excited by our arrival, particularly one male who mounts another behind the car. The abundance of poo and tightly-grazed grass suggests this is a popular haunt. Livestock from four miles around come to stand in this cool valley during the summer months. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing that all my life and all my father\u2019s life. They\u2019ve probably been doing that since the last ice age. It\u2019s just a question of knowing the land,\u201d says Sevier.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In the evening, once the insects have quietened down, the livestock will move back up the hills to take advantage of the longer grass and graze into the night. This large-scale movement of herbivores is replicated in many valleys over the 219 sq miles (566 sq kms) of the <a href=\"https://www.newforestnpa.gov.uk/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">New Forest national park</a>, creating a scruffy mosaic of habitats. Free-roaming herbivores are ecological architects, and beyond the modern pressures of rising house prices, people leaving litter, and debates about over-grazing, this is a farming system that has changed little in 1,000 years.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The New Forest is lowland heathland, a landscape created by people constantly using the land for grazing and removing things like bracken for bedding and wood for construction. These materials are no longer valuable so lots of lowland heathland has become overgrown or been developed on \u2013 around 80% of the UK\u2019s lowland heathland has been lost in the past 200 years. The New Forest \u2013 home to Dartford warblers, nightjars, woodlarks and curlews \u2013 is one of the last remaining strongholds of heathland habitats in the UK.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Like livestock, people are also wedded to this land and knowledge is passed down through generations. The right to be a commoner is attached to land and not bloodlines (perhaps why so many are resistant to moving out) and there are 700 New Forest commoners, some of whom have up to 300 livestock. Old institutions protect these practices \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.verderers.org.uk/verderers-court/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Verderers\u2019 Court</a> deals with those who break forest law (by trespassing, for example), and New Forest ponies are still sold in guineas.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Commoners have a right to pasture, mast (acorns in autumn) and fuelwood. The rights to marl (clay to improve agricultural land) and turbary (cutting peat for fuel) no longer exist. These rights were officially laid out in the Charter of the Forest in 1217 and more recently popularised in James Rebanks\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/04/the-shepherds-life-tale-lake-district-james-rebanks-review\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">The Shepherd\u2019s Life</a> about hill farming in the uplands. Men would typically go off and do contracting work while the women stayed and looked after the land and livestock so there have historically been more women commoners, a trend that continues today. Helping each other out and checking on each other\u2019s livestock is part of the job.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Sevier, who is 70 next year (as she often remarks, surprised each time she says it), is as accomplished as any outback guide \u2013 she knows where the animals will be at what time of year depending on the weather. \u201cI know exactly where the animals will be,\u201d she confirms. Her 14 ponies are out on the commons from April to October and during that time she makes hay on her private land. As well as being an engaged commoner, Sevier is a member of the New Forest National Park Authority. \u201cEveryone wants a bit of me. I\u2019m never going to get my vacuuming done,\u201d she says.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Overgrazing is an extremely contentious issue in the park. Under the Verderers\u2019 Grazing Scheme (VGS), which is funded by EU Common Agricultural Policy grants, livestock owners receive money for putting livestock out in the forest. This has caused numbers to swell. More than 13,500 cows, ponies and donkeys have the right to graze commons in the New Forest, a <a href=\"https://www.advertiserandtimes.co.uk/new-forest-livestock-numbers\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">65% increase</a> in registered animals since 2015. Chris Packham and some scientists have also spoken out about the issue of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/15/new-forest-being-destroyed-by-growing-number-of-ponies-says-chris-packham#:~:text=The%20New%20Forest%20national%20park,subsidies%2C%20according%20to%20Chris%20Packham.&amp;text=Packham%20and%20other%20campaigners%20blame,1960%20to%20around%205%2C000%20today.\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">over-grazing in the park</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt\u2019s bollocks,\u201d says Sevier. Before long she\u2019s back in the Subaru, driving at breakneck speed out of the valley and up into the hills to look at heathland flowers and how long the grass is. Higher up, the landscape is dominated by heather and gorse and looks completely different to the short grass on the valley floor. We find a milkwort, sundew and an orchid and the grass is several inches long in boggy parts where livestock don\u2019t graze. \u201cThese flowers indicate that the heathland is in good condition. You wouldn\u2019t get these rare things if it wasn\u2019t grazed properly,\u201d says Sevier.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Like the rewilded <a href=\"https://knepp.co.uk/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Knepp estate</a>, this landscape is scruffy and unkempt. Sevier dismisses \u201cnew\u201d ideas coming from rewilding. \u201cWhat they\u2019re finding with rewilding is that you can have this amazing landscape full of species, if you let it do its own thing. We\u2019ve been doing it for thousands of years, using large herbivores and letting them do their own thing,\u201d she says.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In the coming decades Sevier says, the park will look \u201chopefully exactly the same\u201d, but alterations to agricultural payments as a result of Britain leaving the EU mean this could be a decade of change for the New Forest. Commoning doesn\u2019t pay, and one of Sevier\u2019s little male foals is worth just \u00a315-20. \u201cUnless you inherit, you cannot afford to be a commoner,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t make any money. It\u2019s love.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">At 42, Lyndsey Stride is a few decades younger than the average commoner. She is a forest school teacher and granddaughter of a \u201cromantic Londoner\u201d who cycled to the forest in her early 20s then moved to the park permanently. Stride now owns 20 cows with her husband, Robert, who is a subcontractor, mainly working for the Forestry Commission.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">There is a charm to commoning life, says Stride. Like Sevier, she can predict the weather depending on which way the cattle turn out of the yard. She takes her two children out on expeditions to find the cattle, which sometimes takes three or four hours. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful way of life. We don\u2019t have expectations about expensive holidays or expensive things because other people come for their holiday here. We don\u2019t fly, if we go away we go to Dartmoor for three days to meet another commoner,\u201d says Stride.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The couple bought their house through the commoners dwelling scheme, meaning they must commit to commoning for as long as they live there. On average only one of these houses is built a year. The New Forest is the UK\u2019s most expensive national park: a house with land goes for more than a million.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Stride\u2019s cows descend from a cow Robert\u2019s mother was given when she got married. Robert\u2019s mother trained her cattle to forage by going out with a bucket and showing them where the best grass grew. Now the cows pass this valuable knowledge down through generations.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Stride still feels like a new commoner. \u201cFor me the difference between the old and new commoners is the depth of knowledge which has been gathered and passed down through the generations. No matter how much I learn or listen to the stories, they aren\u2019t my stories \u2026 I feel welcome but I am deeply respectful of those who have been commoning for a long time.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Commoners graze their cattle in different ways at different times of year. \u201cThe beauty of the forest is that we don\u2019t work as a team,\u201d explains Stride. \u201cIf we were one massive herd and the cattle were all managed in the same way, we wouldn\u2019t get those habitats \u2026 You would never want one system with people expected to conform to those patterns.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Gale Gould moved to the New Forest in 2012. Gould, who is in her 50s and studying for a PhD in the politics of New Forest enclosures, discovered she had commoning rights with her new house. She felt a duty to maintain the tradition and so got half a dozen ponies and prised her way into the community. \u201cThere are no books on it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had to learn to read the landscape.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">She learned to take part in pony drifts, where ponies are rounded up and driven into holding pens by commoners on horseback (these annual autumn drifts were ordered by Henry VIII in 1540 and the methods have changed little since). She learned New Forest terms such as \u201clevancy\u201d and \u201ccouchancy\u201d, which refer to the number of animals that can literally \u201cget up\u201d and \u201clie down\u201d on the land. She learned that asking a commoner how many ponies they own is tantamount to asking a woman how much she weighs.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Very few outsiders learn to become proper New Forest commoners. It\u2019s not just biodiversity, it\u2019s human heritage that\u2019s being preserved here, says Gould. \u201cIt\u2019s about neighbourliness and everyone knowing each other, and helping each other out. A lot of people have only begun to realise this after Covid \u2013 they\u2019ve had to rely on neighbours because they haven\u2019t had friends and family. That\u2019s been really encouraging, but forest people have been doing that since the dawn of time.\u201d</p>", "<p>This piece was edited on 27 November 2020 to correct a reference to commoners\u2019 rights \u2013 these were laid out in the Charter of the Forest in 1217 and not the Commoner\u2019s Charter in 1215 as originally stated</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/james-tapper"], "tags": ["Environment,Climate change,Plastics,Older people,Young people,Society"], "title": ["Move over, millennials.

But as the bird rose into the cloudy November sky, I realised it was actually a juvenile swallow, fully two months after I would expect to see one here in Somerset.</span></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Swallows are the classic spring and summer visitor to our shores; the proverbial sign that winter is over and spring has finally arrived. Having returned here from their homes in Africa in late March or early April, they settle down to raise two or sometimes three broods of young before heading back south in early October.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The reason they come to Britain \u2013 and can be found across much of North America, Europe and Asia \u2013 to take advantage of the long daylight hours of the northern summer, and the resulting abundance of insect food. But as the autumn winds begin to blow, and flying insects become scarce, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/sep/21/top-10-places-to-spot-migratory-birds-uk\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">they must leave</a> or risk starvation. That\u2019s why I was so surprised to see that young swallow in November.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">I\u2019m not alone in seeing late swallows this year. The unusually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/06/uk-set-for-burst-of-vivid-autumn-colours-after-sunny-september\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">mild weather</a> has produced a number of records, mostly in the south-west. Whether they will try to stay, rather than migrate, is still too early to say.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">When I began birding half a century ago, swallows in winter were as rare as snow in summer. During the fieldwork for the British Trust for Ornithology\u2019s <em>Atlas of Wintering Birds</em>, from 1981 to 1984, there were fewer than 150 sightings. Most were in November, with just a handful of records from December and February, and none at all in January.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But since the turn of the century, sightings of late swallows in autumn, and early arrivals in spring, have risen dramatically, and some birds are staying all year round. As the authors of the most recent <em>Atlas</em> survey, covering the years 2007-11, commented: \u201cDespite being a traditional harbinger of spring, swallows are departing later with growing frequency and in some areas attempting to overwinter\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In January 2009, a lone swallow seen regularly at Marazion Marsh in west Cornwall was nicknamed \u201cRambo\u201d for its ability to survive sub-zero temperatures. That same year, four or five swallows overwintered around a Pembrokeshire oil refinery, and one recently spent the winter at a sewage farm in south-east England. Although the number of January sightings each year is still in single figures, according to the BirdTrack scheme, they are on the rise.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Sadly, the chances of these stay-on birds making it through to spring are \u2013 for now at least \u2013 small. But their behaviour may change if the climate crisis continues to accelerate. Tens of thousands of years of evolution have shaped this bird\u2019s delicately balanced lifecycle, which is now under serious threat from rapid environmental change.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">While in the nest, a single brood of young swallows consumes a mind-boggling 150,000 insects. This means that, every single day, their parents need to bring back at least 7,000 items of food. But with studies showing that insects have already declined by up to 75%, the chicks are increasingly likely to starve to death.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">If they do fledge successfully, at just a few weeks old they will embark on that epic journey south. If they make it across Europe and the Mediterranean, swallows then face their greatest challenge of all: crossing the Sahara. If climate change causes the Sahara to expand, their chances of survival will again be severely reduced. And even if they do make it to South Africa, changes in rainfall there could also lead to higher mortality.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Less than six months after arriving in Africa, swallows must head north again to breed. Again, the climate crisis is already exerting its malign influence on their journey. In 2019, unusually warm weather in mid-February caused by tropical air sweeping up from north-west Africa brought the first swallows back to Britain three or four weeks earlier than usual. If there is then a cold spell in late February or early March \u2013 such as the infamous \u201cBeast from the East\u201d of 2018 \u2013 they will be unable to feed and will perish.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Over the years, I have been lucky enough to watch swallows all over the world: from Iceland to Israel and Patagonia to Tanzania, in the skies over the Taj Mahal in India, and cruising among big game animals in Kenya\u2019s Masai Mara. Every time I have seen these elegant birds, I have been struck by their unique combination of strength and delicacy, and their ability to overcome the dangers they face on their global journeys. Now I fear for their future on a rapidly changing planet.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Yet next spring, as I welcome the first returning swallows over my Somerset home, they will bring me hope in these troubled times; a hope I share with millions of other witnesses to their arrival, all across the northern hemisphere, from Alaska to Japan.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><br></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><em>Stephen Moss is a naturalist and author based in Somerset</em><em>, and runs an MA in Nature and Travel Writing at Bath Spa University</em><em>.

The proposals are counterintuitive and premature.</span></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Our system of taxes and charges is designed to serve a range of purposes. In this case there are contradictory objectives. On the one-hand, road charges and fuel excises exist in part as a pseudo user-pays levy for the cost of our road network. On the other, tax policies are often designed to change behaviour \u2013 to act as either a positive financial encouragement or, conversely and more frequently, a disincentive for a particular course of action. Taxes and charges on electric vehicles must surely be considered in that second category.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Proposals to apply new road user charges on electric vehicles send a very strange signal and will set back efforts to reduce emissions from the transport sector. It will have a real impact.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The uptake of electric vehicles in Australia is already low. Much lower than many other nations. For example, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/south-australia\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">South Australia</a>, EVs make up about 0.1% of cars on the state\u2019s roads.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">There are several reasons why Australians have been hesitant to enter the electric vehicle market. One is cost and while we will get to price parity for EV\u2019s during this decade, we are not there yet. The advantage they do already have are lower running costs. The NSW government\u2019s electric and hybrid vehicle plan states that:</p>", "<p><em>EVs offer major benefits over conventional vehicles. For motorists and fleet operators, there are significantly lower fuel and maintenance costs, with charging costs only 25 \u2013 35 per cent that of petrol costs for the average passenger car. These cost of living savings and productivity benefits will flow to households and businesses, and to the wider economy.\u201d</em></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The NSW government is right to identify these advantages and would be wrong to imperil them by following the South Australian pathway.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In fact, a report by Ernst and Young released in September this year, dispels the myth that EVs are a net hit to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/australia-economy\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Australian economy</a> because drivers don\u2019t pay current fuel excises.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Instead, the report found that each EV provides a $8,763 net benefit to the economy over a 10-year life span and, when accounting for the loss of fuel excise revenue, directly contributing more to government revenue per vehicle than petrol or diesel-based vehicles.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">There are significant economic benefits EVs deliver in meeting emission-reduction goals as well as improving air and noise pollution in our cities. Our goal of zero net emissions cannot be met without major changes in the transport sector.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">State and federal governments are investing funds to promote EVs \u2013 from charging stations to research. The federal government is preparing its own low emission vehicle strategy and agencies like Arena have been at the forefront of supporting the development of the EV market in Australia.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">With funding flowing from all levels of government, new state charges on EVs smack of giving with one hand while taking with the other.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">So instead of making electric vehicles, and other future technology \u2013 such as hydrogen-fuelled transport \u2013 more expensive, we should be looking at developing the EV market with lower costs while it matures.

The team lead, Arun Majumdar, was the first head of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, ARPA-E, which incubates energy technologies.

This bill proposes to undermine that system.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Early\u2019s evidence came at a truncated one-day hearing into the proposed legislative change, which is a near replica of a failed 2014 \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d policy for environment approvals proposed by then prime minister Tony Abbott.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The legislation would allow the federal government to sign bilateral agreements with states and territories to hand over approval powers, starting with Western Australia, which has been calling for the change since last year. The government rammed it through the lower house in September after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/03/australian-government-gags-debate-to-ram-environmental-law-changes-through-lower-house\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">gagging debate on the bill</a> and amendments proposed by Labor and the crossbench.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The bill had been criticised for reducing federal oversight of decisions that affect the environment without ensuring the states are equipped to carry out comprehensive assessments.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">It does not include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/27/coalition-condemned-for-failing-to-deliver-promised-environmental-standards\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">national environmental standards</a> or create an independent regulator, both key recommendations of an interim report by Graeme Samuel, a former competition watchdog head who is reviewing the laws for the government.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The bill was planned and introduced before Samuel had completed his review. The government has said it is developing national standards, but they have not been released. It has rejected the call for an independent regulator.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Department officials told the inquiry the legislation being examined was not designed to increase environmental protection, as Samuel\u2019s interim report found was necessary. They said it was designed to \u201crectify anomalies in the EPBC Act when it comes to entering bilateral agreements\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Early said the bill would eliminate the federal government\u2019s ability to respond to the community\u2019s expectation that it take a leadership role in protecting the environment and biodiversity, including meeting the country\u2019s obligations under international treaties.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWithout proper standards and oversight, we would be back to the environmental confusion of the 1970s and 1980s.

They said they would not have an impact on the environment.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Jennifer Westacott, chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, said her members supported Samuel\u2019s findings, which would improve environmental outcomes and efficiency and predictability in assessments. She said the bill was \u201can important first step\u201d that should kickstart a comprehensive reform package including improved national environmental standards, a strong compliance regime and better data monitoring.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Several witnesses, including scientists and representatives from environment and legal groups, told the inquiry the proposed changes went much further than just an administrative change. They said they could hand decisions over matters of national environment importance to state or lower jurisdictions, potentially including regional and local authorities.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Rachel Walmsley, head of policy and reform with the Environmental Defenders Office, said: \u201cThere is nothing in this bill about actually improving environmental protection.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The Australia Institute, a thinktank, told the inquiry only 0.8% of development proposals had been outright rejected under the laws. Early said this data did not take into account proposals that changed through the approval process, but it showed suggestions the laws were \u201ccreating havoc for industry and stopping things is just absolute rubbish\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The government has received Samuel\u2019s final report, but is yet to release it.

What\u2019s blocking the light?\u201d To which Polson replied: \u201cIf the tail comes away at the root, you\u2019ll soon find out!\u201d</p>", "<p>It\u2019s an unlikely story, even as such stories go. The history of wolves is saturated with this kind of machismo and mythmaking. Here are all its stock ingredients: the lupine villain, the plucky hunter, the lucky break. Did it really happen? Probably not. Still, whether Polson is to blame or not, there are no wild wolves left in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Scotland</a>. By 1700, they had also long been extirpated from England and from Wales \u2013 though their old territory is commemorated in the form of names: Ulthwaite, Wolfenden, Wolfheles, Wolvenfield. Their deaths, too: Woolpit, Wolfpit, Woolfall. All across Europe there were centuries of open warfare against the wolf \u2013 that universal antihero, folkloric villain, sharp-toothed grandmother with a glint in her eye \u2013 which saw it hunted relentlessly wherever people lived, persecuted across continents and cultures.</p>", "<p>In Europe, those that survived retreated to rare enclaves, finding sanctuary on the high ground of the Apennines, or fleeing east into the debatable lands where Europe bleeds into Asia. There, the wolves in exile clung on, waiting for an opportunity, preparing for their victorious return.</p>", "<p>If the trajectory of the European wolf is dispiriting, it is also familiar. We have become well acquainted with graphs that plot the advance of humans against the decline of all else. Everywhere we go, it seems, we wreak death and destruction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/30/humanity-wiped-out-animals-since-1970-major-report-finds\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">chipping away</a> at the natural world. But over the last century, a different narrative has been writing itself into existence. In Europe, patterns of farming and land use have been changing on a grand scale, as marginal land \u2013 too steep or too depleted to be worth the effort of farming \u2013 falls into disuse. As the value of livestock has dropped, young people, too, have increasingly abandoned rural areas for cities. When they do, ever more land often goes unclaimed, unploughed, unrestrained. Some estimate that in the three decades leading to 2030, an area the size of Italy will have been abandoned within the EU alone.</p>", "<p>While our attention has been elsewhere, nature has been expanding into the gaps left behind. As annual crops fade away without human input, shrubs and fast-spreading thorns take their place. Then tiny trees take root and the ground starts to bristle with new life as soft and hard woods, hoisted from the earth, spread a densely embroidered tapestry of life across the landscape. The still summer\u2019s air is soon vibrating with the tiny wings of insects. Songbirds raise their voices, trail up and down the scales, an orchestra coming into tune. Rabbits, badgers and foxes dig their homes between the roots. Deer graze in shabby pastures, leap tumbledown gates. Along the rivers\u2019 edges, otters dive and beavers build their dams \u2013 some reintroduced, many recolonising territory of their own accord. Mice nest in old barns. Wild boar rootle in new woods.</p>", "<p>All this Arcadian plenty has tempted in the carnivores, who crept in quietly at first, testing the waters. Lynx: low to the ground, ear-tufted, slinking through the shadows, rarely seen. Some 9,000 of them or more are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/12/missing-lynx-how-rewilding-britain-could-restore-its-natural-balance\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">now thought</a> to live on the continent, having been hunted to local extinction in western and central Europe by the middle of the 20th century. Brown bears: 17,000 of them, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/18/brown-bears-wolves-and-lynx-numbers-rising-in-europe\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">spread through</a> Scandinavia, the Dinaric Alps, the Carpathian mountains, Bulgaria, Greece, Cantabria, the Alps.</p>", "<p>And, of course, wolves.</p>", "<p><span class=\"drop-cap\"><span class=\"drop-cap__inner\">T</span></span>here are an estimated 12,000 wolves <a href=\"https://rewildingeurope.com/rewilding-in-action/wildlife-comeback/wolf/#:~:text=The%20fall%20and%20rise%20of%20the%20wolf%20in%20Europe&amp;text=In%20total%2C%20the%20grey%20wolf,Western%20Russia)%20in%2028%20countries.\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">in Europe</a> now, far more than in the contiguous US \u2013 where the grey wolf was similarly persecuted, until legal protections came into force in the 70s \u2013 and they have now been documented in every single country on the European mainland. In 2017, the first wolf for more than a century was spotted in Luxembourg and the first wolf was sighted in Denmark for 200 years. Last year, wolves were confirmed to have set up home in a Dutch national park. These are all crowded countries, intensively farmed and densely populated, and the wolves\u2019 presence there indicates how closely our ranges have come to overlap. Recently, while the residents of Scanno, Italy, were confined inside to halt the spread of Covid-19, four wolves were seen to hunt a herd of deer through the town; they took down a hind and devoured it right there in the street.</p>", "<p>Mainly, however, the wolves live where we have ceded ground. Iberian wolves now wander the ghost villages of Galicia, and Eurasian wolves haunt abandoned cold war-era <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/germany-s-wolves-are-rise-thanks-surprising-ally-military\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">military sites</a> along the former iron curtain. In the early 00s, they crossed the border into Germany from the dense forests of Poland, finding sanctuary in former army testing ranges and post-industrial ruins. There are now more than 100 German wolf packs, each of five to 10 animals, occasionally more. Where we have withdrawn, they have grown. Our loss has been their gain.</p>", "<p>But then again, maybe that\u2019s the wrong way to think about it. Perhaps their gain could be our gain, too; perhaps their return heralds change for the better, for the whole ecosystem. In recent years, scientists have come to appreciate the full impact that an apex predator, such as the wolf, can have upon its wider environment. The seminal case study that guides thinking on this issue is that of Yellowstone national park, 3,500 square miles of protected land in north-west Wyoming. There, the 1995 reintroduction of grey wolves into the environment after a 70-year absence has <a href=\"https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/wolf-reintroduction-changes-ecosystem\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">offered insight</a> into the influence of large predators upon the behaviour of grazing animals, their prey.</p>", "<p>As far as the elk and mule deer of Yellowstone were concerned, the return of the wolves changed everything. Though they had faced some predation throughout \u2013 not least from humans with guns \u2013 they had grown used to milling freely through the open landscape, grazing hither and thither. Heretofore relatively peaceful sunlit glades and fragrant sagebrush meadows became gauntlets to run, through which they moved as targets. They grew nervy, hesitant. They kept on the move through the clearings, bunching tightly together in agile, watchful groups. They snatched mouthfuls on the move, and ate less overall.</p>", "<p>Around the same time as the wolves were released, the mountain lion population, once hunted to local extinction, was becoming re-established as well \u2013 having crept back in from wilderness areas in central Idaho. Under these twin pressures, over a period of about 15 years, elk numbers halved.</p>", "<p>Those that did survive behaved differently, too: when the wolves were on the prowl, they retreated to the dimly lit comfort of the woods, where they might wander in clandestine bands. They avoided the cougars, most active at night, by steering clear of landmarks where they might be trapped or surprised from above in the dark \u2013 ravines, outcrops, embankments. No longer did they live in an environment defined by its waterholes and pastures, or even by its ridgelines and ravines, but by areas now suffused with danger and relief. A psychological topology, this \u2013 one marked with hillocks of anxiety and peaks of alarm. Ecologists know this as \u201cthe landscape of fear\u201d.</p>", "<p>And as the deer\u2019s psychological landscape metamorphosed in the presence of the wolves, so too did the physical landscape that underlay it. As deer numbers fell and grazing habits changed, the willow, cottonwood and aspen seedlings they had been stripping from the clearings were granted a reprieve. Undergrowth thickened. Leafy stands grew up along the river edges. In this way, fear is a force that shapes the world.</p>", "<p>Across the Atlantic, European environmentalists were paying close attention. Some were interested in what change these self-willed wolves might wreak upon their old haunts. Others were more interested in, essentially, their application \u2013 how wolves might be used as a tool of rewilding and reforestation. Wolves might, they hypothesised, be a way by which ecosystems thrown wildly out of kilter could be brought back into some form of balance. The big bad wolf has returned to favour, in certain ecological circles, at least.</p>", "<p><span class=\"drop-cap\"><span class=\"drop-cap__inner\">H</span></span>ere in Scotland, red deer have been running rampant for decades. Thanks to the lack of natural predators, and the sporting estates\u2019 habit of feeding them through winter, numbers have more than doubled since 1959, rising from 155,000 to an <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/management-wild-deer-scotland/pages/5/\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">estimated</a> 400,000. Highland landowners have been pressed into service as ersatz wolves, and are now required by law to spend months stalking smooth-skinned hills \u2013 bitten down to the quick by hungry mouths \u2013 with loaded rifles; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/20/deer-cull-dilemma-scottish-highlands\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">they do so</a>, some more enthusiastically than others. In this way, last year, 80,000 red deer were culled.</p>", "<p>Many believe this is nowhere near enough, but it\u2019s a time-consuming, expensive process that swallows up thousands of working hours each year. For this reason, our old enemy has been looking a lot more attractive of late.</p>", "<p>But wolves will not return on their own. We are separated from the wolf packs of continental Europe by the sea; if we want wolves in Scotland, haunting the hills, we will have to invite them in.</p>", "<p>The hunting lodge at Alladale sits on a low rise, overlooking the glens that form the body of Paul Lister\u2019s Highland estate, 30 miles inland from the monument at Brora. It\u2019s a grand, stone-built Victorian country house with bay windows and high ceilings. When I arrive there on a hot summer\u2019s day, I find a half-dozen stags dozing peacefully on the lawn, looking sleek and lithe, docile as cows, their antlers trimmed with a velvet of russet and gold.</p>", "<p>I step towards them, right up to them, almost \u2013 I\u2019m maybe three metres away when they finally heave to their feet and swing to face me, almost defiantly, before trotting into the trees that mark the edge of the garden. \u201cNo fear,\u201d comments Lister. That\u2019s the problem.</p>", "<p>The land at Alladale is steeply pitched, dramatic, desperately beautiful. But as a landscape of fear, this time of year, it is smooth and almost featureless. The deer will head up to the high ground over winter, he says, during the stalking season, when all bets are off. But for now they are safe. \u201cThey know, well enough, when it\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p>", "<p>Lister is a vigorous man, slim and tanned, in his 60s. The heir to a vast fortune made in furniture, he has been sinking a sizeable part of it into the rewilding of this Highland estate since he bought it in 2003. Back then, there were 25 deer per square km; today, through a combination of \u201cpopulation management\u201d \u2013 that is, shooting them \u2013 and extensive deer fencing, his staff have brought that figure down to four or five. These days, he doesn\u2019t call it an estate, but a \u201cwilderness reserve\u201d.</p>", "<p>Whatever you want to call it, the results of the work are tangible, easily visible to the naked eye. We bump down a track in a Land Rover to view how this is a place shivering with summer foliage, so unlike the naked hollows of the glens I know so well \u2013 those cavernous spaces, those glacial curves. Birch and aspen tremble along the river\u2019s edge, swollen with the very last of the snowmelt. Scots pine shin up the very steepest slopes, bilberries blooming in their shadow. None of this came about by accident. These trees were planted in batches, tens of thousands of them at a time. The oldest are now approaching two decades in the ground, and are maturing in safety, behind 6ft-high fences that march along the road\u2019s edge and then up and over the ridgeline. Between their branches, unseen, scamper red squirrels: native to the area but boosted by releases from elsewhere. Back at the lodge, wildcat kittens romp in a pen, part of a reintroduction project that could see them set loose within a couple of years. All of it part of the same grand plan.</p>", "<p>But what Lister really wants is this: a 50,000-acre enclosure within which wolves run free alongside the deer and the rabbits and the squirrels and the wildcats and all else. The hope is that the wolves would take it upon themselves to \u201cmanage\u201d the deer population, starting with the weakest \u2013 the old, the sick, the starving \u2013 and working up, keeping them on their toes, on the move, relieving the grazing pressure on the hills and thus liberating the land to attain a level of fertility not seen for centuries.</p>", "<p>Lister views this as a way to restore a crucial self-righting mechanism to an ecosystem thrown haywire, an ecosystem where \u201cnothing makes sense\u201d any more. Morally speaking, he says, \u201cit\u2019s the right thing to do\u201d. Before, we killed the wolves and the bears and the lynx \u2013 trapped them, bludgeoned them, flayed them alive \u2013 \u201cbecause they were inconvenient to us. What gave us the right to eliminate other species? It\u2019s disgusting. So when we have the opportunity to put something back, albeit in a controlled way, it should fill us with joy.\u201d</p>", "<p>Still, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/08/wolves-scotland-reintroduction-lister-alladale\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">his plan</a> \u2013 heavily modelled on the game reserves of South Africa \u2013 retains a great deal of hands-on interference with the \u201cnatural way of things\u201d. The wolves themselves would require population management. \u201cIf you put a pack of wolves in here, they\u2019re soon going to make two packs, then you have to step in and neuter the females. It\u2019s the only way to do it.\u201d The game reserves do it all the time \u2013 \u201cplay God\u201d \u2013 but perhaps it\u2019s the best we could hope for in a broken world.</p>", "<p>\u201cEither that or nothing,\u201d Lister tells me.</p>", "<p><span class=\"drop-cap\"><span class=\"drop-cap__inner\">L</span></span>ister\u2019s wolf plan \u2013 limited though it is in scope \u2013 has met with stiff resistance from almost every corner. Trembling voices speak up at public meetings, frightened for their safety. Bureaucratic hurdles emerge that may prove insurmountable: animal welfare controls prevent the keeping of predators and prey enclosed together; hikers point to their right to roam Scottish lands, enshrined in law. People here, says Lister, have forgotten what it means to live alongside predators. They are obsessed with livestock, their helpless pets. They kick and squeal, refuse to adapt their ways for a wilder future. What could it cost us, this risk aversion? While we\u2019ve been wringing our hands over a few dozen beavers, refusing even to countenance the reintroduction of lynx, Europe has been rewilding of its own accord. Wolves brook no bureaucracy. They do not believe in borders.</p>", "<p>It has been years since we have come face to face with apex predators in our own country. If our fear was a landscape, it would be a prairie, a great plain. The threats we face now are constructions of our devising.</p>", "<p>Our fear of wolves is out of all proportion to the danger they pose us. Wolves very rarely attack humans, and even actively avoid us. One might live a lifetime in the woods with a pack of wolves for neighbours and never see a single one. When thinking of reintroductions, we must be circumspect, realistic: the risk of wolf attack is small. Tiny, even. Still, it is not zero.</p>", "<p>Mark Mennle knows well the risks that wolves can bring. Mark is in his mid-40s, a shepherd from Prignitz, in Brandenburg, in the east of Germany. An itinerant shepherd, he grazes his flock of 600 sheep on state-owned grassland and between the panels of solar farms in a region where wolves have firmly re-established themselves in the space of a decade.</p>", "<p>He, like all farmers in the area, has had to adapt his practices to the wolves\u2019 return. In some parts of Europe \u2013 mountainous regions, where the sheep roam free \u2013 shepherds have reverted to rearing more \u201cprimitive\u201d breeds, better able to fend for themselves against a predator\u2019s threat. In Brandenburg, a flat, rather sandy, plain crisscrossed with rivers and ribbed by dykes, Mennle uses specialist electric fencing, pinning it to the ground to stop wolves getting in underneath. He uses more traditional methods, too: he had to trade in his quick, compliant sheepdogs for a powerful, bear-like breed \u2013 the Illyrian shepherd dog \u2013 that lives in among the sheep as their protectors. But the dogs themselves can be difficult to handle. It\u2019s a hard balance to strike: they must be safe to coexist with ramblers and cyclists, but aggressive enough to start a fight with a wolf. Like hiring Hells Angels as security: things can go sour fast. Last year, a man came by, walking a pet dog \u2013 a scrappy little thing that strained at the lead and barked. One of Mennle\u2019s guard dogs grabbed it, pulling the lead from its owner\u2019s grip, and killed it. The furious man came at Mennle with a stick.</p>", "<p>He has 17 of these guard dogs now. They are expensive animals, each one worth far more than a sheep. \u201cLast year, I had to explain to my seven-year-old daughter that I couldn\u2019t get her a Christmas present because I had to buy a new dog. That was heartbreaking.\u201d He doesn\u2019t own his land. At this rate \u2013 the extra costs of security, the growing losses \u2013 he never will. For even with the dogs, his flock is not safe.</p>", "<p>On 1 March, his phone rang at 7.30am. It was the police, calling to tell him there had been an attack. When Mennle reached the paddock where the assault had taken place, he could see the ravens circling. He knew at once, he says now, that something terrible had happened. What he found there was carnage, a desperate scene: 12 sheep dead \u2013 shredded \u2013 a dismembered mess. Eight more ewes lay broken and bleeding in the grass, some still breathing, heavily pregnant, in the process of dying. Others had gone into labour out of shock, only for the wolves to kill the infant lambs as they emerged. Another 30, Mennle later realised, had been taken, never to be seen again.</p>", "<p>Massacres like this \u2013 killing beyond all possible hunger, as if for sport \u2013 are not unknown among wolves. When hunting deer, they will separate their victim from the herd and seize it; when it falls, its fellow deer will run, abandoning it to its doom. But sheep are different. They stay together. Even as the wolves are stripping their sisters for parts, they herd ever more tightly together, bleating, ready for slaughter. Blood-crazed wolves, adrenaline pumping, will kill, and kill, and kill. As Mark rushed to the scene, he had been struggling to align what the police had told him with what he knew of his animals. He had left the flock miles from here, grazing contentedly, only the night before. The wolves hunted them for 5km,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you imagine that?\u201d</p>", "<p>He gets financial recompense from the state, but \u2013 he says \u2013 not enough to cover the costs. That\u2019s not the worst part. \u201cIt\u2019s the images I can\u2019t get out of my head. You feel for your sheep. You don\u2019t want them to suffer. The bloodbath in the field is not comparable to what the butcher is doing.\u201d This was the sixth attack since 2016. They\u2019re getting worse. Altogether, he\u2019s lost about 300 sheep to the wolves. Still, he hasn\u2019t thought about giving up. The prospect confounds him. What else would he do?</p>", "<p><span class=\"drop-cap\"><span class=\"drop-cap__inner\">A</span></span>s wolf numbers rise across the continent \u2013 as packs grow, split and reform \u2013 here we sit on our island, watching through our fingers, patrolling our perimeters. There is no serious consideration of releasing wolves into the UK countryside \u2013 at least, not in the foreseeable future.</p>", "<p>Efforts to reintroduce the comparatively small and harmless lynx, for example \u2013 seen by some as a stepping stone to the ultimate goal of bringing back wolves \u2013 remain extremely controversial, while beavers \u201cunofficially\u201d released into Scotland\u2019s Tayside 15 years ago, where they continue to thrive, are a major source of contention.</p>", "<p>Farmers, perhaps fairly, feel they have enough to contend with already. The wider public is wary, too. Still, proponents of rewilding hope that, one day, wolves might run free through our wild and rewilded lands. But many barriers stand between now and then. Even under Lister\u2019s hampered plans, returnee wolves would not be reintroduced, but contained behind high fences. The only thing marking them apart from other captive wolves \u2013 of which we have a small number in this country \u2013 would be the size of the enclosure.</p>", "<p>At the Highland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Wildlife</a> Park near Kingussie \u2013 a 260-acre facility run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland \u2013 I stop in to observe the resident wolf pack at feeding time. Here, a family group of six animals lives in a high-sided compound: a square of pine trees, cordoned off and scattered with woodpiles and platforms. I watch them through plastic glass, racing for scraps thrown in over the side. Large animals \u2013 perhaps the size of a great dane \u2013 but limber, agile, flowing over obstacles like water, their legs pistoning. They are shaggily dressed in furs of tawny and buff, with bulky, leonine ruffs around their necks.</p>", "<p>Main course is rolled through in a wheelbarrow: the barrel of a large animal\u2019s ribcage, the fur scorched off. After a feast like this, the wolves will come together to sing. This is bonding. They are strange, and yet familiar. I keep a dog at home \u2013 a retired sled dog I brought back from Finland, where she ran in teams of six or eight or 10. Groups of dogs like these retain something of that pack mentality. They strain at their harnesses, snap, turn on each other. While they wait, they lift their heads and howl, voices coming together and apart. My dog is soft now, submissive \u2013 a pet. But sometimes I see the predator in her flicker awake. It\u2019s in her eyes, the way she moves, the way she pricks her ears.</p>", "<p>But these are not dogs. Look at their pelts, their strength, the size of their heads, their claws. Wild creatures. Or nearly. This pack, the keepers remind me, is an artificial construction. The male and female at its head have an uneasy relationship. They bicker, undermine the other\u2019s authority. They would not have settled for one another, given the chance. Still, they breed. Wolves are good like that. Pragmatic.</p>", "<p>The question is: now what? The female keeps her adolescent daughters in check. Soon, in the wild, these young females would leave the pack in search of mates; roam as lone wolves through strange lands. But there is nowhere here for them to go. They cannot be released \u2013 they likely never will be free. So these captive wolves have taken on an uneasy status: not wild, nor yet domesticates. Are they truly wolves at all?</p>", "<p>Once, in Finland, I woke one still white morning to find wolf tracks threading through the snow right by my cabin. Something fired within me then \u2013 something primal, an instinct half-buried. I\u2019ve never forgotten it. I feel it rise again in me now as I watch the wolves in their enclosure: the way my eyes snag on their powerful gait, their carnivore swagger. This is morbid fascination, and a reckless compulsion. What it demands of me is this: open the gate. </p>", "<p><span class=\"bullet\">\u2022</span> <em>Additional reporting by Theresa Breuer.

Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship from 1964\u20131985 launched programmes to modernise Cerrado agriculture, improve its infrastructure and colonise its remoter areas.</p>", "<p>In the late 1970s, a Japanese-Brazilian programme was launched to help colonise and develop the region to guarantee soya supplies.

But that destruction was attracting international attention and concern: meanwhile the Cerrado stayed below the radar. In a 2017 paper, Soares-Filho and other researchers calculated that while 49% of the Amazon was in protected areas such as conservation units and indigenous reserves, just 7.7% of the Cerrado was. Under Brazil\u2019s 2012 Forest Code, farmers are required to leave 80% of Amazon land as a \u201clegal reserve\u201d, but just 20% in most of the Cerrado region. \u201cThe Cerrado was the poor relation,\u201d said Soares-Filho. As a result, agribusiness loved it.</p>", "<p>The region\u2019s \u201cagricultural frontier\u201d is a huge area Matopiba, home to former president Dilma Rousseff\u2019s Matopiba development agency. \u201cIn the agriculture area, we are still capable of picking low-hanging fruit \u2013 and at the same time, expanding the tree,\u201d <a href=\"http://g1.globo.com/videos/v/dilma-rousseff-fala-sobre-a-importancia-da-criacao-da-regiao-de-matopiba/4159134/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Rousseff said</a> at the launch in 2015. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a very special moment.\u201d </p>", "<p>Farmers who moved into the region were realistic. \u201cOur ambition was never to get rich, but we wanted to have something in life,\u201d said Paulo Dalto Neto, who came to farm here in 1997. Land was cheap in this dry, inhospitable region, but he has been able to improve his soil, develop the local roads and plant hardy soya strains with high yields.</p>", "<p class=\"pullquote-paragraph\">The soya here brought us very few jobs \u2026 and brought us many disadvantages</p>", "<p>The losers were the Cerrado\u2019s traditional communities, who usually did not have legal titles to land they had used for generations. Soya farmers prized this land and in some cases unscrupulous land dealers were able to buy or simply steal it by falsifying documents. \u201cThe soya here brought us very few jobs \u2026 and brought us many disadvantages,\u201d said Juarez de Souza, 63, from the tiny <a href=\"https://www.cptnacional.org.br/publicacoes-2/destaque/4988-nota-publica-no-cerrado-policia-expulsa-moradores-da-terra-onde-produzem\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Melancias community in Piau\u00ed</a>. </p>", "<p>De Souza\u2019s community is now engaged in a legal battle to prove ownership of their land, while the river local people used for water and fishing has, according to De Souza, been polluted by pesticides. He says he has received threats from land grabbers looking for land to sell on to bigger farmers. \u201cFor them the soya is gold,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of money.\u201d</p>", "<p>Moreover, the change in land use is now altering the climate of the region.

It\u2019s the best pound for pound source of protein so it\u2019s hard to convince farmers to move away from it,\u201d chicken farmer Charles Mears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/14/grubs-up-why-maggot-meals-are-a-hit-on-one-uk-chicken-farm\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">told the Guardian last month.</a></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Soya is a smaller part of the diet of other farmed animals and appears to be easier to replace.

There is a small but growing supply of soya <a href=\"https://ensa-eu.org/european-cultivation/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">produced</a> in Europe, but it is not yet competitive with producers in the Americas. It is currently <a href=\"https://www.poultryworld.net/Home/General/2019/8/European-soy-has-its-limitations-457790E/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">more profitable</a> for European farmers to grow alternative crops to soya. The main sources of organic soya are China, India, the US and Russia.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Retailers are linked through their supply chains to deforestation because they buy meat and dairy products from UK farmers who use soya. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/05/deforestation-chaco-companies-full-responses\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">response to pressure</a>, they have come out with a variety of policies that attempt to limit or eliminate links with deforestation.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Most of them do this by committing to ensuring that their suppliers only use \u201cresponsibly-sourced\u201d soya, relying on a range of certification schemes to deliver on this. There is no internationally-agreed definition of responsibly- or sustainably-sourced soya. Instead it is left to individual private certification schemes such as the <a href=\"https://responsiblesoy.org/?lang=en\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Roundtable on Responsible Soy</a>, which states that it guarantees zero deforestation and zero conversion in its certified soya production.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But such schemes have different tiers of certification. The most basic tier involves buying offsets for soya in their supply chain. The money goes to support farmers producing soya responsibly, but the soya in the supply chain is not necessarily responsibly-sourced. <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/about-aldi/corporate-responsibility/resources-for-our-products/deforestation\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Aldi</a> and <a href=\"https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/our-planet/conserving-forests.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">McDonald\u2019s</a> are among companies that say they use credits.<br><br>The next tier up works on the basis of what is known as \u201carea mass balance\u201d. Certified soya is mixed up with non-certified soya, but the amount of certified soya is tracked. So while the actual soya you buy may not be certified, you create a market for certified \u2018responsibly sourced\u2019 soya by buying it through this tier. Tesco <a href=\"https://www.tescoplc.com/sustainability/publications/policies/downloads/soy-policy/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">has said</a> all of its soya will be covered by this tier by the end of 2020.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The highest tier is buying only segregated soya, which means the soya comes from a certified source and is kept separate from other non-certified soya throughout its journey along the supply chain to farmers. Sainsbury\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/making-a-difference/be-a-place-where-we-all-love-to-work/our-stories/2019/04-2019-sustainable-soy#:~:text=In%20response%20to%20this%20challenge,not%20linked%20to%20global%20deforestation.\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">has said</a> it will work with its suppliers of fresh chicken, pork, eggs and aquaculture to only source area mass balance or segregated soya by 2023.

Companies would also be banned from sourcing commodities, including soya, that have not been produced in line with the laws of countries where they originate. A consultation on the proposals concluded last month.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Details about the due diligence that firms will have to undertake to ensure products are deforestation-free have not yet been announced. It is also unclear if compliance with local laws would be enough to guarantee that soya has no links with deforestation.

The environmental impact varies hugely from country to country.

At the time, it announced $30m (\u00a322.6m) in funding efforts to address deforestation but did not specify where this would be spent. The Guardian asked Cargill why it had rejected a moratorium, but the company did not comment on this.</p>", "<p>It expressed its commitment to a deforestation-free supply chain, however, and to supporting farmers who are working sustainably. It said: \u201cCargill estimates that 95.68% of our soya volumes in Brazil for the 2018-19 crop year were deforestation- and conversion-free.\u201d The company is continuing to expand its certification programme in Brazil and Paraguay, but put the emphasis on the Brazilian legal system. \u201cCargill \u2013 along with our industry, farmers, local governments and customers \u2013 has accountability for transforming the food supply chain, and we are engaging with stakeholders every day to make progress,\u201d it said. \u201cDeforestation in that biome is, in most cases, a criminal act by Brazilian law.

A cow that will \u201cdo good\u201d on grass alone.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">She\u2019s got a \u201cbig butt\u201d, Judy says, meaning wide hips that will help her easily bear calves when grown. She sports a shiny, slick red hide that flies avoid landing on; cows stressed from fly bites \u2013 Judy has seen hundreds on a single cow \u2013 don\u2019t grow well. She has a large \u201cbarrel\u201d or gut, meaning enough stomach capacity to store large amounts of grass, which she will convert to energy and will keep her in good health, even during the winter with no extra feed. \u201cThis is the kind of heifer you want,\u201d Judy says. \u201cYou can build a herd out of those.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Judy raises cattle in a highly\u2013managed, grass-only system that he believes is better for his cows and the environment. His 300-plus herd is kept together in a dense group, and moved often \u2013 Judy moves his cattle twice a day to fresh paddocks \u2013 creating a symbiotic relationship between cows and grasslands that soil scientists are finding encourages soil health and rapid grass growth.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But Judy has learned not all cows thrive on grass alone, especially the type of cattle favored by a US ranching industry that has grown largely dependent on feeding cattle grain rations.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In Judy\u2019s system, those \u201ccommon cows\u201d, as he calls them, looked like they had been starved six months after he put them on a grass-only diet. Instead, Judy found success \u2013 after nearly going bankrupt in 1999 trying to raise cattle the conventional way \u2013 utilizing intensive, grass-based management with cows that had the \u201cgrass genetics\u201d to thrive.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cAt the end of the day, the money comes from animals that can excel on a grass diet,\u201d says Judy, referring to the lower costs of raising cattle with a genetic predisposition to thrive on grass, since they don\u2019t require the grain, growth hormones and antibiotics often used in traditional cattle ranching.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">It\u2019s a counterintuitive problem, considering cows evolved to eat grass. But today, <a href=\"https://www.stonebarnscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Grassfed_Full_v2.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">approximately 97%</a> of US beef cows spend the last four to six months in confined feedlots where they are fed grain rations until slaughter. Before that, they spend most of their lives out on the pasture, but even then some ranchers feed them grain to keep their weight up through winter or during stressful times like calving.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Meanwhile, the grass-only beef market is small, but growing rapidly, according to a <a href=\"https://www.stonebarnscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Grassfed_Full_v2.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">report by Stone Barns Center.</a> The intensively managed grazing Judy employs is a supercharged version of traditional cattle-grazing techniques. By moving his cows often, they do not have a chance to damage the grass by eating it too short. Instead, they encourage healthy root development increasing soil health, which some scientists have found allows the soil to capture and store carbon from the atmosphere \u2013 a process known as carbon sequestration.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This heavily managed grazing style \u2013 also called holistic grazing \u2013 is part of a growing worldwide interest in \u201cregenerative agriculture\u201d. By promoting multiple practices that build soil health, regenerative agriculture has been said to <a href=\"https://www.jswconline.org/content/jswc/early/2020/07/31/jswc.2020.0620A.full.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">improve agricultural lands and ultimately sequester carbon</a>, according to Rattan Lal PhD, an Ohio State University soil scientist and the 2020 World Food Prize winner.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But the growth of regenerative grazing systems has been slow, in part because, as the cattle industry turned to feeding grain, ranchers ended up breeding fewer cows that could thrive on grass alone,<strong> </strong>says Richard Teague PhD, a range ecologist with the Texas A&amp;M University Agrilife Research center. Ranchers like Judy were put in a pickle, without the cows appropriate for their grass-only systems.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cPeople wanted to feed corn, [so] they bred huge animals that require very big inputs of corn and also pharmaceuticals,\u201d says Teague. He argues that raising \u201ccattle like that\u201d comes at the expense of the health of consumers \u2013 and the health of the soil that nurtures them. \u201cWe have to go to animals that we know thrive under good management.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The traditional ranching industry denies the charge that grass-raised cows are better for the climate than their grain-fed product. In a <a href=\"https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/carbon-footprint-comparison-between-grass-and-grain-finished-beef.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">2017 study by Oklahoma State University</a> researchers found that grain-fed cattle \u2013 with their shorter lifespans \u2013 resulted in a 18.5 to 67.5% lower carbon footprint compared with grass-finished beef.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Meanwhile, a <a href=\"https://www.fcrn.org.uk/projects/grazed-and-confused\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">2017 report from the Food, Climate and Research Network</a> challenged the idea that grass-fed beef can be good for the environment at all, saying there was no evidence that grazing cattle helps sequester carbon except under the most ideal conditions.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">However, Teague argues, \u201cIt\u2019s not the cow, it\u2019s the how.\u201d A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7995\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">2015 study in Georgia</a> of dairy cows in an intensively grazed system recorded eight tons of carbon sequestered per hectare annually. The intensive livestock grazing systems such as Judy uses are one of the best ways within agricultural systems to sequester carbon, according to Teague. \u201cUnder decent management, sequestration exceeds emissions, and the better the grazing management, the more it exceeds it.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">For Judy, it comes down to raising cattle in a system that works with nature instead of against it. But to do that, he also had to find the best cattle to thrive in his environment. For him, that perfect cow is the South Poll.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A relative newcomer to the beef cattle scene, the South Poll is a small-framed, stout, highly fertile red cow, well adapted to hot and humid conditions. It has good mothering instincts that have earned it the nickname the \u201csouthern mama cow\u201d. The breed also has a rock star \u2013 or at least, country music star \u2013 cachet; it was originally developed in the 1990s by Teddy Gentry, the bass player for the country music group Alabama.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Judy is far from alone in his enthusiasm for this up-and-coming breed. In mid-September, South Poll cattle fans from all over the US showed up in Copan, Oklahoma, for the annual South Poll cattle auction. The cows are becoming increasingly popular with grass-focused ranchers \u2013 especially in the south-eastern and midwestern US where the cattle are best adapted \u2013 according to Ann Demerath, secretary of the South Poll Grass Cattle Association.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Some of the animals purchased at the auction may be cross-bred with other cattle breeds. Ranchers hope to use the South Poll genes to adapt their existing cattle to do better on a grass diet, Judy says. He advises ranchers to start by purchasing the \u201cbest South Poll bull you can afford\u201d and breed it to the best females in their existing herd. Then, ranchers should select the best females from that generation and breed those with a South Poll sire \u2013 a technique called \u201cline-breeding\u201d that quickly focuses on desirable traits without risking genetic defects.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Judy also advises ranchers to cull \u2013 or remove \u2013 any animals that don\u2019t fit their standards for health and disposition, even if they \u201clook at you funny\u201d, from their breeding stock. His mantra? \u201cYou\u2019ll never have a herd any better than what you are willing to cull for.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Relentlessly selecting for the best-adapted cows within his own system has allowed Judy to produce South Poll mother cows so well-adapted that they stay healthy through the winter. That means, unlike most ranchers, Judy can give the mothers more time with their calves during the winter<strong>, </strong>which gives those calves an extra boost of growth and leaves him with a stronger, bigger calf in the spring.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">For Judy, that is the goal \u2013 a cow that needs nothing but well-managed grass, passing their health and wellbeing on to the next generation.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe animals,\u201d Judy says, \u201care just healthy.\u201d</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nina-lakhani,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maanvi-singh"], "tags": ["Thanksgiving,Poverty,Coronavirus,US news"], "title": ["'No end in sight': hunger surges in America amid a spiraling pandemic"], "date": ["2020-11-25T09:00:23.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p>Unprecedented demand for food aid is on the rise as states across the country contemplate new lockdowns</p>", "<p class=\"css-vdb1rb\">Last modified on Wed 25 Nov 2020 20.48 GMT</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><span class=\"css-17ehqsd\"><span class=\"css-1ljoi60\">M</span></span><span class=\"css-38z03z\">illions of Americans must rely on charity to put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/thanksgiving\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Thanksgiving</a> dinner on the table this year, as hunger surges amid a devastating spiraling of the Covid-19 pandemic which the Trump administration has failed to get under control.</span></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In what is traditionally a season of celebration, less than half of US households with children feel \u201cvery confident\u201d about having enough money to afford the food needed over the next month, according to the US <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/as-thanksgiving-approaches-fewer-than-half-of-households-with-kids-very-confident-about\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Census Bureau\u2019s latest pandemic survey.</a> A staggering 5.6m households struggled to put enough food on the table in the past week.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Families of color are suffering disproportionately</a> with 27% of black and 23% of Latino respondents with children reported not having enough to eat sometimes or often over the past week \u2013 compared with 12% of white people.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Overall food insecurity has doubled since last year due to record unemployment and underemployment rates.

Since the start of the pandemic, four of every 10 people seeking food aid are first-timers.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Hunger is not new in America. Even before the pandemic, 35 million people relied on food banks every year, according to Feeding America. But the pandemic has been catastrophic \u2013 despite initial lauded federal interventions such as the stimulus cheques and enhanced unemployment benefit. As many as <a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/Brief_Local%20Impact_10.2020_0.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">50 million people could experience hunger this year, </a>including a quarter of all children.</p>", "<p><strong>How to help</strong></p>", "<p>Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs.\u00a0</p>", "<p>As this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help.</p>", "<p><strong>Donate money or supplies</strong></p>", "<p>The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families.</p>", "<p>If you want to help,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank?s_src=W203REFER&amp;s_referrer=https://map.feedingamerica.org/&amp;s_subsrc=https://secure.feedingamerica.org/site/SPageServer?pagename&amp;_ga=2.25572606.2138835403.1585660508-969297754.1585660508\">find your local food bank</a>, and go to their website to donate.

In New Mexico, one in three children are experiencing hunger this year, according to Sonya Warwick of Road Runner Food Bank, headquartered in Albuquerque.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">As most federal benefits have expired and the third stimulus bill, the Heroes Act, continues to languish on Capitol Hill, advocates are increasingly frustrated at the lack of political will to implement measures which would reduce hunger for families.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cFood insecurity is a leading indicator of the economy \u2026 it would be super great if the government could respond appropriately, the unnecessary delays have caused real suffering,\u201d said Schanzenbach.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">At the heart of the frustration is the food stamps program (Snap) \u2013 a highly effective anti-poverty tool which also benefits the economy. As hunger increased, the Trump administration failed to boost Snap \u2013 as the Obama administration did during the great recession \u2013 while continuing to pursue cuts to eligibility.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand the lack of political will to address this when the county is in such a dire emergency,\u201d said Ellen Vollinger, legal director for the Food Research &amp; Action Centre. For years, advocates have urged governments to increase the real value of food stamps as many recipients turn to food banks because they run out of groceries after two or three weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Another program, the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Farmers to Families scheme that has helped deliver more than 110m boxes of fresh produce to food banks over the last few months, is set to expire by the end of the year. \u201cLess food, more people hungry,\u201d said Susan King, president of the Northeast Florida Food Bank who on Monday was informed that the scheme would end this week.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A $450m boost to the federal Emergency Food Assistance Program for low-income families is also set to run out.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Even with help from these programs, some food banks have been forced into bidding wars against Walmart, Costco and other chain grocery outlets to buy enough groceries for those in need. Without government assistance, \u201cwe\u2019re headed toward a massive cliff come January\u201d, said Erin Pulling, CEO of the Food Bank for the Rockies which serves Colorado and Wyoming. They are budgeting to spend an extra $300,000 a month starting next year in order to partially replace the produce from Farmers to Families. Pulling added: \u201cWe just can\u2019t serve as many people if this program ends.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">At the same time, national guardsmen called in to help pack and distribute food have pulled back. \u201cWe\u2019re asking all healthy, young folks who can to come out and help,\u201d said Angie Rogers of the Arizona Food Bank Network. \u201cEspecially in December ahead of the Christmas season, we\u2019re going to see need go up.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Almost two thirds of Feeding America food banks are looking for volunteers.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Nationwide, demand for food aid has plateaued at about 60% higher than pre-pandemic times. In some regions of the US, communities had only just recovered from the huge impact of the Great Recession when coronavirus \u2013 and the economic crisis it triggered \u2013 struck.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Even as hopes build about the rollout of vaccines in coming months, experts warn that the economic fallout is likely to last much longer and will require systemic changes not just crisis intervention.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In California\u2019s Silicon Valley, many working-class families could barely afford to make rent before the pandemic. \u201cWith the high cost of living here, even federal and local benefits are really inadequate,\u201d said Leslie Bacho, CEO of Second Harvest Food Bank. \u201cEven those who are still working are struggling.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Almost 20% of adult renters, that\u2019s 13.4 million people, are currently behind on their rent, according to analysis of the latest Census Bureau survey by the <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/as-thanksgiving-approaches-fewer-than-half-of-households-with-kids-very-confident-about\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>. Black renters face the greatest hardship, with 33% behind on rent, followed by 24% of Native Americans.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Mike McDonald, CEO of the Southern Arizona Food Bank said it was imperative to shift away from expensive emergency relief \u2013 like food aid \u2013 to structural changes like a living wage and affordable healthcare which promote economic, food and housing justice. \u201cWe need investment in prevention and social maintenance so people\u2019s lives are better and there\u2019s a real safety net.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThe inequalities that existed before as a result of hundreds of years of structural racism have been exacerbated by the pandemic,\u201d said Christina Maxwell, director of programs at the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take communities an extraordinarily long time to recover from this. We\u2019re not talking about going back to the old normal.

But in this case, with its green flowers well camouflaged and very low to the ground, the couple surmised that the <em>Guthriea capensis</em><em> </em>(commonly known as \u201cthe hidden flower\u201d) must belong to the few species <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534796100677\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">pollinated by small ground-dwelling mammals</a> such as mice and elephant shrews. Despite first being described in 1876, the plant\u2019s ecology had never been studied, so they set out to investigate.</p>", "<p>It didn\u2019t take much to persuade Dr Sandy-Lynn Steenhuisen at the University of the Free State\u2019s department of plant sciences and Prof Steven Johnson of the Centre for Functional Biodiversity at KwaZulu-Natal to join the couple on a two-week \u201cworking holiday\u201d in the mountains.</p>", "<p>Leaving their base at around 6am, the group spent more than 12 hours on the mountain every day, lugging everything from motion-trigger cameras to rodent traps and peanut butter bait balls up and down the steep slopes the <em>Guthriea</em> call home in their quest to work out who was pollinating the flowers. They often left the site in complete darkness, as thick mist swirled around them. \u201cI\u2019ve never been involved in such a physically demanding project,\u201d says Steenhuisen, who frequently found herself lagging behind trail-runners Cozien and Van der Niet.</p>", "<p>The plants\u2019 flowers were so low to the ground that simply setting the camera traps was a challenge which involved either digging into the stony ground (\u201cand trying not to accidentally kick a rock on to a hiker below\u201d) or using the very steep terrain to aim the shot \u201cup the plant\u2019s skirt\u201d, says Cozien. They were fairly convinced that the plants were being pollinated by nocturnal rodents, and initially set the cameras to only record at night.</p>", "<p>After five frustrating days of getting no closer to finding their pollinator, the team changed tack. They started recording all day and increased the motion-sensitivity settings so that smaller creatures could also trigger the traps.</p>", "<p>It paid off. Late one night, while downloading the new data over beers at the lodge, Johnson came across an image of a lizard visiting the flowers. The 26-centimetre <a href=\"https://www.gbif.org/species/2471048\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">Drakensberg crag lizard</a> (<em>Pseudocordylus subviridis</em>) is \u201csuper common\u201d in the study area, says Cozien. \u201cBut none of us expected lizards to be the pollinators. In fact, we never even considered it.\u201d In the days to follow they got more and more footage of lizards sticking their snouts deep into the flowers to drink the nectar.</p>", "<p>Lizard pollination is, according to Cozien, \u201camong the rarest and most poorly understood pollination systems globally\u201d. The first published observation of lizards visiting flowers to feed on nectar was from the Portuguese island of Madeira in 1977, and since then as many as 40 species of geckos and lizards have been observed doing the same.</p>", "<p>But visiting a flower is very different to pollinating it, Cozien says, \u201cespecially because they often eat the flowers!\u201d Lizards have only been shown to be important for pollination of \u201cat most five\u201d species in the world, and only one species of plant was known at the time to use reptiles as its primary pollinator.</p>", "<p>Partly because lizard pollination often occurs in harsh, inaccessible or disturbed environments, pollination experts around the world are, Cozien admits, \u201cstill trying to work out what floral traits are important for the attraction of lizards, why it evolves where it does, and how important pollination by lizards really is. For all we know, there are loads of other examples.\u201d</p>", "<p>After tweaking the camera settings (being cold-blooded, lizards aren\u2019t very good at triggering heat sensors), the team got more footage of the lizards devouring the nectar (which, Cozien says, tastes \u201cabsolutely vile\u201d to humans, \u201clike bitter, burnt plastic\u201d) at all times of the day and throughout the flowering season. After catching some of the lizards, the scientists were able to confirm that, thanks to the adhesive properties of the very sticky nectar, the lizards were carrying <em>Guthriea</em> pollen on their smooth, scaly snouts.</p>", "<p>By restricting the lizards\u2019 access to some of the plants, they also found that after a few weeks there were 95% fewer fruits on the plants not visited by lizards. Back at the lab, they dusted the anthers of some male flowers with powdered dye and watched as the now pink-cheeked lizards spread the dye (and thus the pollen) on the reproductive parts of the female flowers.</p>", "<p>The scientists had discovered only the second known plant to use reptiles as its primary pollinator, and the first to do so on the African continent.</p>", "<p>The only other plant that is known to use reptiles as its primary pollinator is <em>Trochetia blackburniana</em>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1618895/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">a three-metre-high tree with bright red flowers</a> on the island of Mauritius which is pollinated by geckos. Cozien says: \u201cIt is striking that the red of the <em>Trochetia</em> flowers matches the red markings on the geckos\u2019 bodies, just as the orange glands at the base of <em>Guthriea</em> flowers match the orange markings on the crag lizards\u2019 bodies.\u201d This suggests that the flowers pollinated by lizards may be tuning in to sensory channels that the pollinators already use.</p>", "<p>And the similarities between <em>Trochetia </em>and <em>Guthriea</em> don\u2019t end there. Both have cup-shaped flowers that contain yellow-orange coloured nectar. Coloured nectar has already been shown to be important for <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1618895/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">attracting gecko pollinators</a> to <em>Trochetia </em>flowers, says Cozien, \u201cso we think it plays a similar role in attracting lizards to <em>Guthriea </em>once they have used colour cues to find the flowers under the leaves\u201d.</p>", "<p>Confirming the<a href=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2670\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\"> first case of lizard pollination</a> on the African continent was \u201cjust a completely mind-blowing experience\u201d, says Cozien. \u201cWe thought we were going to document something cool but expected.

Buying used is also a challenge due to the small number of electric vehicles on the road in Australia.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Pallas said in presenting the tax that the money made would be invested in improving roads. But some experts doubted that the tax would, whether directly or implicitly, go towards fixing roads.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIf fuel excise funded roads, we\u2019d be driving on gold plated roads by now,\u201d said Holmes \u00e0 Court, explaining that fuel excise had not directly gone into roads since 1959.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">He said it was a tax like any other tax, such as wine excise or income tax, and that there was no specific connection between fuel excise taxes and investment in roads.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt\u2019s a myth,\u201d Jafari said, pointing out that it was not the state government that collects fuel excise taxes.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cFuel excise is recovered by the federal government, and you have the state government saying it wants to tax this, so they\u2019re not making up for lost tax revenue today. It\u2019s more of a tax grab by them.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Uptake is fairly low right now, but many believe that electric vehicles will eventually make up a majority of cars on the road. With a road usage tax already in place, the state government will then be well placed to take advantage.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThis is about introducing a tax now, when there is almost no constituency,\u201d Holmes \u00e0 Court said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">From a budgetary perspective, he conceded the tax made some sense, but said there were more challenges from an environmental perspective.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIf you\u2019re a treasurer, this is a smart move. If you\u2019re an environment minister, this is dumb. You are slowing down the transition to electric vehicles by putting them out of reach of more Australians.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The government anticipates that the tax will bring in $30ma year. However, Holmes \u00e0 Court believes the tax could bring in \u201ca couple of billion a year\u201d by the 2030s.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Introducing the tax then could prove more difficult than doing so now, according to Jafari, who said that to some degree, the government was motivated to introduce it because they do not anticipate much pushback.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A report by Ernst and Young released earlier this year found the opposite. The report said electric vehicles each provided a net benefit of $8,763 to the economy over a 10-year life span, and that they directly contributed more to government revenue that petrol or diesel-based vehicles.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">So, in a sense, advocates argue that owners of electric vehicles are already pulling their tax weight, without the introduction of a usage charge.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Marion Terrill, the transport and cities program director at the Grattan Institute, said the call for fairness had more weight than other arguments, but people still needed to consider the environmental impact of the vehicles.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThis argument needs to have injected into it is a consideration that you\u2019re contributing to lower emissions than would have otherwise been the case.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Terrill also said the issue with the tax was less about focusing on the wealthy and more about how the tax would affect those on the margins and in two minds about purchasing an electric vehicle.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cI think price increases will affect people at the margin, people thinking \u2018Oh, will I or won\u2019t I?\u2019 A price increase is likely to affect their decision.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The impact on uptake was a point Jafari returned to often, saying that adding more charges onto electric vehicles would put people off from making the switch.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThis actually has a harmful impact on equity. If you want to make something accessible to people, you make it cheaper not more expensive.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Terrill and the Grattan Institute suggested an alternative tax should instead look at congestion, arguing that if the goal was to address costs and emissions, a tax on electric cars would miss the mark.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWhat I find disappointing about this proposal is that it doesn\u2019t address congestion \u2026 which we know to be a very significant cost on the community \u2013 there\u2019s a significant productivity opportunity there.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt would allow you to delay building new infrastructure because it helps to spread out usage across the day, and it would encourage people who can be flexible about when they travel or how they travel to do so.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Other ideas, such as taxing vehicles based on weight (and potential damage done to roads) or a tax based on distance travelled, have been tossed up.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But Jafari argues that because such taxes are far more wide reaching, they\u2019d be far more difficult to sell to the public.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe government has just decided it\u2019s too difficult for them, because it\u2019s always difficult to explain new taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only reason they\u2019re pursuing electric vehicle taxes is because so few people are driving electric cars.\u201d</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/eleanor-ainge-roy"], "tags": ["Whales,New Zealand,Pacific islands,Asia Pacific,Marine life,Wildlife,Cetaceans,Environment"], "title": ["More than 120 whales die in mass stranding on Chatham Islands"], "date": ["2020-11-25T01:03:18.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p>Ninety-seven whales died and dozens more had to be euthanised by rescue workers</p>", "<p class=\"css-vdb1rb\">Last modified on Wed 25 Nov 2020 01.13 GMT</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A mass stranding on the far-flung Chatham Islands in the Pacific Ocean has resulted in the deaths of more than 120 whales.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Ninety-seven pilot whales and three dolphins have died in the stranding, with 28 pilot whales and three dolphins having to be euthanised, said staff from New Zealand\u2019s Department of Conservation (DoC).</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The Chatham Islands is part of New Zealand but lies 800km to the east, delaying the mission to rescue the animals.

However, the earlier autumns mean that significantly less carbon can be stored in trees than previously thought, providing less of a brake on global heating.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Scientists are still working out how large the effect is likely to be, but it might amount to 1bn tonnes of CO2 a year, which would be more than the annual emissions of Germany.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The new research is based on a huge dataset of observations of European trees, experiments that varied light and CO2 levels, and mathematical models. It showed that as well as temperature and day length, the amount of carbon a tree has absorbed in a season is a key factor in determining when it no longer needs its leaves and sheds them. The scientists liken the effect to a person becoming full after a heavy meal and being unable to eat more food.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Other recent research has shown that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/08/shorter-lifespan-of-faster-growing-trees-will-add-to-climate-crisis-study-finds\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">trees that grow rapidly have a shorter lifespan</a> and that the climate crisis and the mass felling of trees has overall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/08/shorter-lifespan-of-faster-growing-trees-will-add-to-climate-crisis-study-finds\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">made their lifespans significantly shorter</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cFor decades we\u2019ve assumed that growing seasons are increasing and that the autumn leaf-off is getting later,\u201d said Prof Thomas Crowther at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, who was one of the study team. \u201cHowever, this research suggests that as tree productivity gets higher, the leaves actually fall earlier.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Earlier models that did not include the amount of carbon a tree absorbs during a season indicated that autumn could be two to three weeks later by the end of the century on current emissions trends. But the scientists\u2019 new model indicates autumn may actually come up to six days earlier. \u201cSo the increases [in carbon storage] will be nowhere near as great as what we expected,\u201d said Crowther.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Christine Rollinson, an ecologist at the Morton Arboretum in Illinois, USA, who was not part of the study team, said the earlier models were known to be simplifications but were the best available.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe big challenge is that autumn has always been a bit of a mess,\u201d she said. \u201cDepending on where you are and which species you\u2019re looking at, there\u2019s some evidence that leaf fall is happening earlier and some that it\u2019s happening later. But understanding how well a tree grows during the season really helps explain that tree-to-tree variation.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWhat is particularly amazing about the study is how it provides such different lines of evidence to reach the same conclusion,\u201d she said. But she was cautious about the impact of earlier autumns on overall carbon storage: \u201dIt\u2019s really not clear yet how this is going to cascade down.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Rollinson said it remained critical to cut emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation to tackle the climate emergency: \u201cWe can\u2019t put all of the responsibility on to [growing] trees.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The research, <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abd8911\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">published in the journal Science</a>, used more than 430,000 leaf fall observations from trees at 3,800 sites across central Europe from 1948 to 2015, as well as experiments and modelling.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Photosynthesis in leaves converts CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere into carbon compounds that the tree uses to live and grow.

Since Patricia died seven years ago, I have come to appreciate the wonderful legacy she left me.</p>", "<p>I never seemed to have time to study the birdlife around me before; I just liked the idea they were around and I enjoyed their dawn chorus over the years.</p>", "<p>In a fairly small space I am pleased to be visited regularly by many species of bird.</p>", "<p>My friendly robins follow me around listening to my mutterings (they later bring some of their youngsters), but most of the birds are extremely shy and need coaxing with refreshments to stay around. Now, during my isolation vigil, I watch them as carefully as I did when photographing people.</p>", "<p>I know very little about birds but admire their grace and beauty.</p>", "<p>I became intrigued by the behaviour of the goldfinches with their vivid striking colours who come to feed and drink. Extraordinary things happen. They love the sunflower hearts I put out for them, but they defend their territory jealously, often squabbling in what seems a frightening show. But that is what it is: a show. In minutes they are all best mates, although other species are unwelcome at the feeders. They are fiercely repelled whenever they try to share. Then, strangely, different species will often gather at the water feature at the same time and seemingly tolerate each other.</p>", "<p>A gathering of goldfinches is aptly called a charm, and they have charmed their way through the ages and appeared in many Renaissance paintings, including a Raphael masterpiece. The birds are often linked to paintings as theological symbols.

Thomas Hardy believed in protecting the birds from cruel imprisonment, and The Caged Goldfinch is in one of his collections of poems.</p>", "<p>My grandfather\u2019s generation loved the birds so much they sadly just had to capture and cage them. So fond were they that, when the birds died, they were sought-after taxidermy specimens, placed under glass domes to be admired.</p>", "<p>But now that I can admire them from afar with a telephoto lens, I notice, never before as intensely, the beautiful displays revealed in flight, which is mostly at the speed of light. They arrive, settle to feed or sip from the birdbath, and then in a fraction of a second they are gone. I set myself a challenge to capture those missing seconds. It often took me days to arrest just one of those wonderful moments of takeoff and flight \u2013 something normally almost invisible to us. A blink and you\u2019ve missed it.</p>", "<p>It was so rewarding to see the graceful movements and displays of perfectly designed plumage. Sometimes \u2013 I\u2019m either getting quicker or luckier \u2013 I manage a shot before they disappear out of frame. So many near misses, though. I just use the camera I have at hand \u2013 digital now, of course, after almost a lifetime with film. I don\u2019t have a hide, I just sit quietly on an old bench and try to merge into the background.</p>", "<p>The garden with azaleas and rhododendrons in bloom often makes an almost impressionistic backcloth for my new airborne friends.</p>", "<p>Blue tits find tasty food in my apple blossom, and they love to bring their young to bathe. The juveniles treat this opportunity like a lido and dive in without a care, coming up for air after being completely submerged and looking like dishevelled kids who have had a really good time. This is until a gang of young house sparrows arrive to fill the pool.</p>", "<p>A greenfinch calls, then a nuthatch with a streamlined profile swoops across. Long-tailed tits bring their youngsters to share the fun with house sparrows who are determined to get into the frame, and the blackbird leaves his singing perch on the silver birch to take a dip.

Tropical species would be unlikely to survive a British winter, but many cockroaches live indoors in the UK in basements and cellars. \u201cThese are species that wouldn\u2019t survive in the wild, but they do survive in human habitation. So it does get slightly more complex than just whether or not they survive in the wild,\u201d said Shardlow.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The filming is close to an ancient woodland managed by the Woodland Trust, which is a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). A spokesperson from the trust said: \u201cThere is currently no evidence that species used in filming have not been contained. Nor do we know what those species are, so we are unable to give any indication of what the impacts might be.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe matter of whether there has been any breach of the law is one for the police, and we do not wish to pre-empt the results of their investigation.

The ground underneath crunches with a layer of swollen acorns. There are more than I can ever recall seeing \u2013 a magnificent acorn bounty repeated in reports from across England. And the size of them! More like artillery shells than nuts. This is what we call a mast year.</p>", "<p>Mast is a traditional term for nuts produced by trees in the beech family \u2013 including oaks and sweet chestnuts, but also hazel (which has now been reclassified as a birch). Oak and beech go for several years producing small crops and then, boom, all the trees of the species, at sub-continental scales, are laden. The frequency of these mast years varies, sometimes every seven to 10 years, and then quickening like a heartbeat to every two or three years; consecutive mast years are fabled, but rare.</p>", "<p>The causes, mechanisms and coordination of this phenomenon continue to be debated, but it is thought that the stochastic abundance benefits the trees. The sudden glut of acorns may enable the oaks to first put them past the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/12/country-diary-wasp-gall-pulborough-brooks-west-sussex\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">gall wasps</a> and then to overwhelm acorn-feeding birds and mammals.

This is not the ideal place for an oak to germinate: they are much more vulnerable to defoliation caused by winter moths than their parents, and are more likely to thrive if they do fall, or are transported away from the tree and its caterpillars.</p>", "<p>The word mast comes from the Scandinavian \u201cmat\u201d, meaning food. Acorns were once collected and fed to pigs, a tradition that persists with pannage in the New Forest. Although toxic to horses, acorns are edible, if bitter, and would once have been a staple in human diets as well.</p>", "<p>The last big mast year for oaks was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/25/acorns-in-short-supply-say-forestry-commission-and-naturalists\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">in 2013</a> and the Woodland Trust, <a href=\"https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/blog/2020/10/what-is-a-mast-year/\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">which monitors these things</a>, is waiting to see if 2020 has eclipsed that year.</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebecca-ratcliffe"], "tags": ["Whales,Thailand,Evolution,Asia Pacific,Biology,Cetaceans,Environment,Marine life,Science,Wildlife,World news,Sea level,Oceans,Fossils"], "title": ["Ancient whale skeleton found in Thailand holds clues to climate change"], "date": ["2020-11-27T18:31:23.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p>Scientists hope remains, thought to be up to 5,000 years old, will deepen knowledge of whale species and of rising sea levels<br></p>", "<p class=\"css-vdb1rb\">First published on Fri 27 Nov 2020 14.38 GMT</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A whale skeleton thought to be up to 5,000 years old has been discovered, almost perfectly preserved, by researchers in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/thailand\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Thailand</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The skeleton, believed to be a Bryde\u2019s whale, was found in Samut Sakhon, west of Bangkok.

Fur industry sources expect the fur from the remaining 5 million to 7 million mink will be sold.<strong> </strong></p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A number of Covid mink variants were identified by Denmark\u2019s state-owned research body the Statens Serum Institut, but only one, known as C5, raised vaccine efficacy concerns. However, Denmark\u2019s health ministry said last week that the C5 mink variant was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">very likely extinct</a>\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Mink are known to regularly escape fur farms and the risk that infected mink are now in the wild was confirmed on Thursday.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cEvery year, a few thousand mink escape. We know that because they are an invasive species and every year hunters and trappers kill a few thousand wild mink. The population of escaped mink is quite stable,\u201d said Sten Mortensen, veterinary research manager at the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This year, Mortensen said, there was a risk that about 5% of the minks that escaped from farms were infected with Covid-19.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The risk of the escapees infecting other animals was low, he said, because mink were \u201cvery solitary creatures\u201d. But, if they did, the animals most likely to catch the virus would include wild animals such as ferrets and raccoon dogs and \u201csusceptible domestic animals\u201d such as cats.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The most likely transmission route, he said, would be by an animal eating an infected mink or via their faeces.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Mink do not normally die from Covid-19, he added. \u201cOnce a mink has had Covid it usually recovers well. Some might have a few days of respiratory difficulty, but most recover and develop immunity.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The risk of Sars-CoV-2 moving into wild populations has drawn concern from other scientists. Prof Joanne Santini, a microbiologist at University College London, said that, once in the wild, \u201cit will become extremely difficult to control its further spread to animals and then back to humans\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Transmission to the wild meant \u201cthe virus could broaden its host-range [and] infect other species of animals that it wouldn\u2019t ordinarily be able to infect\u201d, Santini said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Prof Marion Koopmans, head of viroscience at Rotterdam\u2019s Erasmus University, in an email to the Guardian, said: \u201cSars-CoV-2 could potentially continue to circulate in large-scale farms or be introduced to escaped and wild mustelids [weasels, badgers, otters, ferrets, martens, minks, and wolverines] or other wildlife\u201d and then \u201cin theory, as avian flu and swine influenza viruses do, continue to evolve in their animal hosts, constituting a permanent pandemic threat to humans and animals.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In the US, there are hopes a mink vaccine will soon be ready. Dr John Easley, vet and research director at the <a href=\"https://furcommission.com/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Fur Commission USA</a> said he hoped \u201cone of three vaccine possibilities\u201d would be available by spring for mink farmers in the US and beyond.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">However, a mink vaccine is a contentious issue for animal welfare organisations. \u201cInstead of dealing with the fact that the appalling conditions of high-volume, low-welfare fur farming make mink so vulnerable to disease in the first place, it\u2019s easier to distract everyone with talk of a vaccine that could be used like a yearly sticking plaster to compensate for the consequences of those poor welfare conditions,\u201d said Wendy Higgins of Humane Society International.<br><br><em>Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/animals-farmed/2018/feb/21/animals-farmed-join-us-for-monthly-updates-newsletter-updates\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Animals farmed monthly update</a> to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

It is responsible for the movement of 90% of all global trade. Even in normal circumstances, more than a million seafarers labour daily on the vessels that make up the world cargo fleet, their work barely noticed by consumers.

Most have not been designated key workers during the pandemic, and have remained effectively imprisoned on board their vessels \u2013 unable to change crews at ports, and therefore unable to return to their homes and loved ones.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The silence on the plight of these stranded seafarers is widespread: from the governments that have decided shipping crew are not essential workers, to the major retailers that profit from tremendous sales. This failure takes on renewed importance now, as new vaccines against Covid-19 are developed and the conversation turns to who should be inoculated first. The International Maritime Organisation, the UN body for shipping and seafarers, has failed to get countries to uphold standards of care and repatriation for seafarers. They are, in effect, lost at sea.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Many have been so for more than a year, with their physical and mental wellbeing deteriorating rapidly as a result. They work in some of the world\u2019s toughest conditions to satisfy global retail demand, and their struggle has been recognised by Pope Francis and Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations. As yet, however, we have heard little from those in the retail sector who actually have the power to make a difference.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The majority of shipping seafarers are from the Philippines, China and India, and it is perhaps the case that some in the west see their plight as a problem for the other side of the world. But shipping is a truly global enterprise, and the potential ramifications of continued indifference are just as universal. Not only does the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/one-seafarer-almost-cried-the-last-chaplain-visiting-quarantined-boats\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">humanitarian crisis at sea worsen every day</a>, but the failing health of our seafarers affects productivity, which in turn hurts the seamless transportation of goods around the world.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">As things stand, a few major retailers are poised to profit immensely from the work of seafearers in the rush for goods on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The International Chamber of Shipping has written <a href=\"https://www.ics-shipping.org/press-release/open-letter-bezos/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">an open letter to Jeff Bezos</a>, CEO of Amazon, asking him to use his influence to exert pressure on governments to recognise seafarers as key workers, so that they can change crews, go home and be reunited with their families.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The plight of seafarers is global, and requires a global response. Governments must give seafarers the same rights as other essential workers, and corporate responsibility must extend to seafarers as it does to other employees. Retail profiteering at the hands of trapped men and women must end.

One 27-year-old woman said: \u201cI feel like I can\u2019t in good conscience bring a child into this world and force them to try and survive what may be apocalyptic conditions.\u201d</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">These views were based on very pessimistic assessments of the impact of global heating on the world, the researchers said. One respondent, for example, said it would \u201crival world war one in its sheer terror\u201d. The research also found that some people who were already parents expressed regret over having their children.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Having a child also potentially means that person going on to produce a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">lifetime of carbon emissions that contribute to the climate emergency</a>, but only 60% of those surveyed were very concerned about this carbon footprint.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe fears about the carbon footprint of having kids tended to be abstract and dry,\u201d said Matthew Schneider-Mayerson, of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, who led the study. \u201cBut the fears about the lives of existing or potential children were really deep and emotional. It was often heartbreaking to pore through the responses \u2013 a lot of people really poured their hearts out.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The number of people factoring climate change into their reproductive plans was likely to grow, Schneider-Mayerson said, as the impacts of global heating became more obvious. \u201cTo address this, we really need to act immediately to address the root cause, which is climate change itself,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The study, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-020-02923-y\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">published in the journal Climatic Change</a>, found no statistically significant difference between the views of women and men, though women made up three-quarters of respondents. A 31-year-old woman said: \u201cClimate change is the sole factor for me in deciding not to have biological children. I don\u2019t want to birth children into a dying world [though] I dearly want to be a mother.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The researchers found that 6% of parents confessed to feeling some remorse about having children. A 40-year-old mother said: \u201cI regret having my kids because I am terrified that they will be facing the end of the world due to climate change.\u201d </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Schneider-Mayerson said: \u201cI was surprised \u2013 for parents, this is an extremely difficult statement to make.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The study is the first peer-reviewed academic study of the issue and analysed a large group of concerned people. The survey was done anonymously so people could express themselves freely.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt is an unprecedented window into the way that [some people] are thinking and feeling about what many consider to be the most important decision in their lives,\u201d said Schneider-Mayerson. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Other findings were that younger people were more concerned about the climate impacts their children would experience than older respondents, and that adoption was seen as a potential alternative to having biological children.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The study indicated that climate-related fears for their children\u2019s lives were rooted in a deeply pessimistic view of the future. Of the 400 respondents who offered a vision of the future, 92.3% were negative, 5.6% were mixed or neutral, and just 0.6% were positive.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">One 42-year-old father wrote that the<strong> </strong>world in 2050 would be \u201ca hot-house hell, with wars over limited resources, collapsing civilisation, failing agriculture, rising seas, melting glaciers, starvation, droughts, floods, mudslides and widespread devastation.\u201d Schneider-Mayerson said he thought the pessimistic views held were all within the range of possibilities, if not necessarily the most likely outcome.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">However, he said further research was needed on a more diverse group of people and in other parts of the world. The self-selecting group in the study all lived in the US and were largely white, more highly educated and liberal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Previously, opinion polls of the general public indicated people were connecting the climate crisis and reproduction, with one poll in 2020 finding that among 18- to 44-year-old US citizens without children, 14% cited climate change as a \u201cmajor reason\u201d for not having children. In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/12/birthstrikers-meet-the-women-who-refuse-to-have-children-until-climate-change-ends\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">scores of women</a> in the UK said they were starting a \u201cbirth strike\u201d until the climate crisis was resolved.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Seth Wynes, of Concordia University in Canada, whose 2017 study found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">having one less child was the greatest impact individuals can have in fighting climate change</a>, said the researchers had properly stressed that the sample was not representative of all Americans. But he said the distress over the decision to have children made sense. \u201cClimate change is already affecting our world in frightening ways and so it\u2019s certainly reasonable to account for the climate crisis when thinking about the future of one\u2019s family.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cAs climate change continues to worsen, it is important to understand how perceptions of the future can change the way everyday people plan their lives,\u201d Wynes said. \u201cThis study is an initial step in growing that understanding.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">There is also growing evidence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/10/overwhelming-and-terrifying-impact-of-climate-crisis-on-mental-health\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">climate anxiety affecting mental health</a> and earlier in 2020 more than 1,000 clinical psychologists <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU6L3NM12ikT-34ZPlp1yv-6nHcM5aqhmid6nK-M3plZGu3A/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">signed an open letter</a> warning of \u201cacute trauma on a global scale\u201d.

Decades later, while on a trip to the Arctic with Greenpeace, the gently comical sight of a flying puffin, which is listed as vulnerable on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/iucn-red-list\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">IUCN red list</a>, was a respite from the grief and trauma of watching glaciers disappear. \u201cThere always seems to be a think bubble above their heads as they\u2019re flying, which is \u2018I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019m going to be able to keep this up!\u2019 because their wings go so fast,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p>", "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/10/earths-sixth-mass-extinction-event-already-underway-scientists-warn\">sixth mass extinction in geological history has not only begun</a> but is accelerating, according to some scientists, who warn that it may be a tipping point for the collapse of civilisation.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/01/sixth-mass-extinction-of-wildlife-accelerating-scientists-warn\">A report in June 2020</a> found more than 500 species of land animals were found to be on the brink of extinction and likely to be lost within 20 years. In comparison, the same number were lost over the whole of the last century.</p>", "<p>The land vertebrates on the verge of extinction, with fewer than 1,000 individuals left, include the Sumatran rhino, the Clari\u00f3n wren, the Espa\u00f1ola giant tortoise and the harlequin frog.</p>", "<p>The analysis, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1922686117\">published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, examined data on 29,400 land vertebrate species compiled by the IUCN red list of threatened species and BirdLife International. The researchers identified 515 species with populations below 1,000 and about half of these had fewer than 250 remaining. Most of these mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians were found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>", "<p>Changes to the climate are reversible, even if that takes centuries or millennia, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/10/up-to-48-species-saved-from-extinction-by-conservation-efforts-study-finds-aoe\">conservation efforts can work</a>. Since 1993, up to 48 bird and mammal extinctions have been prevented by conservation efforts. But once species become extinct, there is no going back.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Thompson hopes the event helps people to realise their deep links with other living things. \u201cThat innate connection is what will save us, and to speak of it poetically or amusingly or artistically in any way is merely to remind people of what they already know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just adding another voice to the great chorus that is rising from everywhere at the moment, voices saying we can\u2019t go on destroying our landscape, our planet, the great numbers of other organisms or species with whom we share the planet.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">As a child, Thompson was a junior member of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. When she was filming In the Name of the Father in 1991, people started talking about bottled water and how stupid it was. \u201cTwo decades later we\u2019re going \u2026 \u2018this is ridiculous \u2013 we\u2019ve got more plastic in the oceans than fish?\u2019 If something could go badly wrong in 30 years, it can also go seriously right in the next 10,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">From Toronto, Atwood will be speaking about the endangered Tasmanian devil, a dog-like marsupial whose ferocity reminds her of climate activist Greta Thunberg. \u201cI chose this creature because I have seen it in its habitat, I\u2019ve followed its footprints across a beach in Tasmania, and I have watched it move through several threats and partial recoveries,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">For Atwood the penny dropped about climate issues in the 50s. Humanity had dodged a number of bullets \u2013 ozone depletion, acid rain, DDT pesticides, atomic bombs \u2013 and scientists who spotted early signs of global heating were mainly ignored. Now people are listening, she said, as shown by the rise of Extinction Rebellion. \u201cWhat we have to think about \u2026 is do we want to be a species? Are we already a threatened species? Are we investing in our own extinction? That is the question \u2026 If no action is taken, we\u2019re going to go over the cliff. It\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Having lived through several periods of protest over the years, Atwood says this is the first time the protests have been about the climate, which is forcing politicians to face up to the problem. \u201cThere\u2019s no point not having some hope. Because if you have no hope you do nothing,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Ghosh became interested in Irrawaddy dolphins in 2000 when he was travelling by boat through a mangrove forest in Bengal and saw a dead one washed up on the mud bank. Years later he got in contact with a researcher from New Zealand and spent a week surveying the dolphins in the Mekong River where there are an estimated <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/irrawaddy-dolphin#:~:text=The%20Mekong%20River%20Irrawaddy%20dolphins,are%20estimated%20to%20still%20exist.\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">92 </a>of them left.

Tim Kasser, an emeritus professor of psychology at Knox College in Illinois, who co-authored the report, said there was a body of evidence to show that in order to make progress in addressing and reversing climate and ecological degradation, it would be prudent to rein in and change the practices of the advertising industry.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThis report argues that enough sound empirical evidence exists to support the conclusion that the advertising industry indirectly contributes to climate and ecological degradation through its encouragement of materialistic values and goals, the consumption-driving work and spend cycle, and the consumption of two illustrative products, namely beef and tobacco,\u201d Kasser wrote.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The researchers examined several studies linking exposure to advertising with increased materialism.

Australia\u2019s use of the Kyoto-era concessions has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/09/about-100-countries-at-un-climate-talks-challenge-australias-use-of-carryover-credits\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">strongly opposed by a large number of nations</a> in international climate discussions, and experts say there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/australias-use-of-accounting-loophole-to-meet-paris-deal-found-to-have-no-legal-basis\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">no legal basis</a> for their use under the Paris agreement.</p>", "<p>After Biden\u2019s victory, Morrison used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/20/scott-morrison-signals-retreat-on-using-carryover-credits-to-meet-emissions-targets\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">a speech to business leaders to signal</a>, hey presto, magic happens: Australia might not deploy the accounting trick to help meet the 2030 target after all. The prime minister said: \u201cMy ambition is that we will not need them and we are working to this as our goal, consistent with our record of over-delivering.\u201d The hint from Morrison was that new projections, expected to be released in December, will show Australia is on track to meet the promised cut without carryovers.</p>", "<p>In part, because the Australian government has not been great at forecasting future emissions and tends to substantially change its estimates each year.</p>", "<p>Estimating future emissions is difficult. Each year, officials make assumptions about what will happen in 50 areas of the economy and come up with projections of how much will be emitted. For more than a decade, they have significantly overestimated how much CO<sub>2</sub> the country will emit in the years ahead before revising down the projections, sometimes significantly.</p>", "<p>The biggest miscalculation has been in electricity generation. Renewable energy has come into the grid much faster than the government expected \u2013 the national 2020 renewable energy target was met ahead of time, state targets in Victoria and Queensland have started to have an impact and the cost of solar and wind energy continues to drop, making investment more attractive. Officials also overestimated how much grid electricity the country would use \u2013 demand has fallen, in part due to nearly a third of homes now having solar panels.</p>", "<p>For reasons that are not clear, the official projections have assumed there would be less renewable energy in the system than the models used by the Australian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" class=\"u-underline\">Energy</a> Market Operator, which runs the power grid. Addressing this will bring future projections down.</p>", "<p>There are other anomalies. The projections do not factor in drought, which in recent years has reduced emissions from agriculture as farmers have had to substantially reduce cattle and sheep numbers.</p>", "<p>Officials last year revised down the emissions forecast for the next decade by 344m tonnes. If a similar readjustment were to happen this year, it could lead to the government saying it was now on track to meet its modest 2030 target without the carryover credits.</p>", "<p>The only new policy of note from the Morrison government this year has been its low-emissions technology roadmap. Released in September, it claimed developing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/27/what-are-the-key-technologies-in-the-coalitions-low-emissions-roadmap-and-can-they-deliver\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">five new technologies</a> could \u201cavoid\u201d 250m tonnes of emissions a year by 2040.</p>", "<p>There was been no explanation of how that number was reached, and with the arguable exception of \u201cclean\u201d hydrogen, the government has not yet committed significant new funding to develop the technologies. It is unclear how this policy could reasonably change the projections in a meaningful way.</p>", "<p>More noteworthy is that, while the federal government has tried to slow the influx of solar and wind by neither continuing nor replacing the renewable energy target, the states keep stepping in to fill the gap.</p>", "<p>The big one is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/10/nsw-promises-to-build-more-renewable-energy-than-victoria-and-queensland-combined\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">NSW plan</a> to underwrite 12 gigawatts of new wind and solar over the next decade \u2013 a development that will be banked by Canberra as \u201cprogress\u201d in terms of projected national emissions reductions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/23/nsw-energy-plan-wont-drive-early-coal-closure-minister-says-amid-spat-with-angus-taylor\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">but also criticised</a> by the federal energy minister, Angus Taylor, because it might bring forward the closure of coal plants, which is of course a necessary development if you are a government now wanting to trumpet a downward trend in emissions. You know it makes sense.</p>", "<p>Lower emissions would, of course, be great. But if it happens it isn\u2019t something we should get too excited about, for two reasons.</p>", "<p>The first should be pretty obvious \u2013 the government will not have actually done anything yet. These are projections, not actual emissions.</p>", "<p>Before Covid-19 hit, Australia\u2019s national emissions remained stubbornly flat under the Coalition, having dipped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/23/john-kerry-biden-climate-envoy-appointment\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">only about 2%</a> in the more than six years since it was elected. They will be lower this year due to the pandemic, but that is not something the government can claim credit for, and it may not continue.</p>", "<p>The second reason is, as mentioned above, Australia\u2019s target is nothing to crow about. It was a fudge from the beginning. The size of the cut \u2013 26%-28% \u2013 was just a lift of the US commitment under the Paris agreement, with one notable difference \u2013 the Obama administration promised that target for 2025, while the Australian government pushed it back to 2030.</p>", "<p>Getting to net zero emissions, as scientists say is necessary, isn\u2019t just about the end goal. It\u2019s about how much you emit as you get there. To play its fair part in meeting the goals of the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/files/meetings/paris_nov_2015/application/pdf/paris_agreement_english_.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">Paris agreement</a>, Australia can only emit so much over the next three decades.</p>", "<p>Advice to the government in 2015 suggested playing its part would require a cut equivalent to <a href=\"https://www.climatechangeauthority.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-06/CFI/CCA-statement-on-Australias-2030-target.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">between 45% and 65%</a> by 2030. A recent analysis by analysts at the Climate Action Tracker found Australia\u2019s fair share over that timeframe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/immense-potential-of-renewable-energy-could-propel-australia-to-net-zero-2050-target\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">was 66%</a>. The current target does not get the job done.</p>", "<p>It is not impossible, but it is far from guaranteed.</p>", "<p>There will be pressure on Australia over the next year not only to set a target of net zero by 2050, but to go further by 2030 than promised. The US under Biden will be required to set a new target for that date and other major countries are expected to do the same. Dropping the plan to use carryover credits will not be enough to satisfy their expectations.</p>", "<p>Apart from saying we can meet our (lowball) 2030 target without a Kyoto-era accounting trick (cue applause) there\u2019s no sign at the moment the government is working up a higher 2030 target. It is working on a long-term climate strategy, which was a commitment under the Paris agreement. It was due this year, but has been pushed back to before the next major climate summit in Glasgow late next year. It is expected, but not guaranteed, to include modelling of what future action on climate will mean for Australia.</p>", "<p>There are a couple of other policies in the works. The government has dumped a long-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/22/well-be-left-behind-australias-electric-car-inertia-is-getting-it-nowhere\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">promised electric vehicle strategy</a> and replaced it with the promise of a \u201cfuture fuels\u201d plan on hydrogen, electric and bio-fuelled vehicles, but it is not expected to deliver significant new commitments to accelerate an emissions cut.</p>", "<p>Potentially more significantly, it has also said it will look at the safeguard mechanism, a Tony Abbott-era policy that was supposed to limit emissions from big industrial sites. So far, the scheme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/13/no-purpose-to-coalitions-climate-policy-after-big-polluters-increase-emissions-by-16m-tonnes\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">has barely justified its existence</a>. Companies have mostly just been allowed to increase their CO<sub>2</sub> limit, known as a baseline, and pollute more.</p>", "<p>Presumably recognising this is not sustainable, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/coalition-reveals-new-emissions-reduction-measures-including-paying-polluters-to-stay-under-cap\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">earlier this year</a> said it accepted a recommendation from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/coalition-scrambles-for-carbon-cutting-solutions-as-paris-targets-move-further-out-of-reach\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">review headed by former Business Council of Australia president Grant King</a> that the mechanism should be changed so that companies would be rewarded for cutting emissions below their baseline if they were undertaking \u201ctransformative\u201d projects and not just producing less or shutting down. It sounds like a step back towards carbon pricing \u2013 rewarding cuts and, if the Coalition can stomach it, finally penalising increases in emissions.</p>", "<p>Morrison should use his political capital and his internal authority to drive a substantive change \u2013 but he won\u2019t want to lose his job over it. Part of what\u2019s going on with Morrison\u2019s shift in language is the prime minister testing how much he can get away with: how positive can he sound about emissions reduction before the right of the Liberal party starts having a tantrum, or before the National party has a public meltdown because someone has whispered coal is not good for humanity after all? Think of Morrison as inching along a dimly lit ledge several stories above the ground.</p>", "<p>But the rest of the world isn\u2019t waiting for the Coalition to get its act together. Action on emissions is picking up elsewhere and at some point Australia will have to deal with rising CO<sub>2</sub> from big industry and transport. </p>", "<p>In the meantime, as the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO recently reported, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/nov/13/rising-levels-of-carbon-dioxide-increasing-extreme-weather-events-in-australia-report-finds\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">climate change is already here</a> and extreme weather events are getting worse.</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amy-jane-beer"], "tags": ["Birds,Environment,Rural affairs,UK news,Birdwatching,Wildlife"], "title": ["Country diary: an ambitious young sparrowhawk has killed her last thrush"], "date": ["2020-11-28T05:30:50.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p><strong>Welburn, North Yorkshire: </strong>As her hunting improved she became a comet, a thunderclap.

But Aemo suggested investment in gas was less likely to make sense than cleaner options due to cost. It didn\u2019t consider the impact of the emissions from gas, but it was the only fossil fuel on the list.</p>", "<p>Analysts make a similar case, with a caveat. While the amount of gas-fired power generation is expected to continue to fall in the next few years, McConnell and Edis say there may be a case for new plants to be built as more of the country\u2019s coal fleet shuts, depending on how much other technologies have developed.</p>", "<p>These plants would hardly ever be used, and would not contribute much to emissions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gas\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" class=\"u-underline\">Gas</a> plants differ from batteries and pumped hydro at the moment in that they can sit idle for all but a few hours a year and be called on only at times of absolute need, as diesel generators are in some places now.

They were then picked off and sold for bloodletting.</span></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The parasites were so popular that by the early 1900s they were nearly extinct, and there was a coordinated effort to save them. Even so, the European medicinal leech, <em>Hiru</em><em>do medicinalis</em><em>, </em>has been labelled as near threatened on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/iucn-red-list\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">IUCN red list</a> since 1996, and remains one of the few parasites with formal protections.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Only 4% of known parasites infect humans but it is no surprise that these freeloaders are not in favour. Conservation funding tends to follow charismatic creatures, and ticks, tapeworms and fleas are not good PR for parasitism. Malaria, which is caused by a bite from a mosquito infected by the plasmodium parasite, killed an estimated <a href=\"https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">408,000 people in 2018</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt\u2019s not the sort of thing WWF or Conservation International is going to be doing work on,\u201d says Colin Carlson, a biologist at Georgetown University in the US who has just published <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.1841\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">a paper</a> in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B arguing for a global parasite project to record parasitic life on Earth.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Parasitism refers to a type of ecology \u2013 or lifestyle \u2013 where a living thing feeds off a host. Because parasites hide in hosts, they are difficult to study (often you do not know they are there) so it was assumed they were not that important and probably did not have much impact on overall food chains. More recent research has shown that this assumption is wrong, as parasites significantly alter food chains.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Increasingly, scientists are finding that parasites are puppet masters, shaping ecosystems by changing the behaviour of their host species. <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/103/30/11211\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Research in California</a> showed parasites were involved in 78% of links in the food chain. Rough estimates suggest there could be <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/693564?journalCode=qrb\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">80 million parasites</a>, but only 10% have been identified.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Carlson says we know next to nothing about them. \u201cWhen we think about plants and herbivores and carnivores, there are parasites operating on every part of that food web \u2013 they\u2019re this kind of dark matter. There are these unaccounted for links and forces in the network that we often can\u2019t quantify.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Carlson believes conservationists underestimate public support and interest in parasites. \u201cPeople assume that because they\u2019re gross, there\u2019s not going to be any interest,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think, actually, it\u2019s quite the opposite \u2026 People like the idea that there\u2019s this entire hidden world within animals that we know nothing about. People love frontiers, right? They love the deep ocean and deep space and there is a frontier inside every animal on Earth.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The global parasite project could lead to half the world\u2019s parasites being described in the next decade, researchers say. The project would start by bringing in taxonomists and training them to work together across different institutions and countries to create one huge joined-up collection.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Over the past few years, this approach has gained traction and funders are increasingly interested in \u201cmoonshot\u201d endeavours to create global catalogues of life. Last year the <a href=\"http://www.globalviromeproject.org/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Global Virome Project</a> was set up to catalogue 85% of viral diversity within vertebrates to the tune of $1.2bn (\u00a3900m). The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/human-genome-project\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Human Genome Project</a>, set up in 1990, was created to sequence and map all human genes.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">For parasitology, the nature of the problem might also require an unprecedented effort. \u201cParasitism is arguably the most species-rich mode of animal life on Earth, and parasites likely comprise a majority of the undescribed or undiscovered species left to modern science,\u201d researchers wrote in Carlson\u2019s paper.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Understanding parasites is urgent because the climate emergency could wipe out one in three parasites, according to <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/9/e1602422\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">another paper</a>, published in Science Advances in 2017. Parasites could be particularly vulnerable to climate breakdown and wildlife loss because they often require two or more host species to complete their life cycle. If parasite abundance declined, it would leave vacuums into which invasive parasitic species could thrive \u2013 potentially increasing the risk of disease spreading as they jump on to new hosts.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Parasites also have fascinating life cycles. For example, nematomorph parasites, known as horsehair worms, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/22/2/392/208177\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">make their cricket hosts drown themselves</a> in streams, at which point the worm wriggles out and completes its aquatic life cycle. A sea louse called <em>Cymothoa exigua</em>gets inside a fish\u2019s mouth and feeds on blood from its tongue. The parasite then attaches itself to the withered tongue and feeds on blood and mucus in the mouth, while also replacing the function of the original tongue and helping the fish to grind food.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">One of the first landscape-scale demonstrations of the importance of parasites came in 2011 with the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3720037/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">eradication of rinderpest</a>, which killed cattle, buffalo and wildebeest in Africa. Once it was eradicated, the abundance of herbivores increased dramatically in the Serengeti national park, where long-term monitoring was taking place. In turn, this increased the abundance of predators such as lions and hyenas, which hunted these herbivores. More grazing animals meant there was less fire and grassland ecosystems transformed into scrub.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Carlson says the \u201cexploration narrative\u201d of going into the jungle and looking for undiscovered species is probably not the approach these parasite-hunters should take, because a lot of these samples have already been collected.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cMuseums are the home of basic science, especially in parasitology,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything that we know about where parasites are found, and how to tell the species apart, all of that comes from work that is carefully developed over months and years by scientists working with museum collection. And specifically by taxonomists who are this kind of dying group of scientists who are essential to basic science, but don\u2019t necessarily have that flashy appeal of exploration.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Many museum collections are chronically underfunded and understaffed, and even those with more funding are often not digitalised, which makes it hard to share information. Hundreds or thousands of parasite species have probably already been identified but are inaccessible to the wider community.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Parasites are tiny so it can take years of meticulous research to tell species apart. Carlson\u2019s proposal is just a blueprint, he says. \u201cI\u2019m not starting anything \u2013 I have enough to do \u2013 it\u2019s more sort of this question of \u2026 if someone wanted to do it how would they do it?\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Shaun Keegan, a disease ecologist from the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the research, says a global parasite project would definitely help monitor potential health threats to humans and livestock. \u201cThe hypothetical project is certainly ambitious. That being said, there is no reason as to why one shouldn\u2019t be ambitious,\u201d he says.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe authors rightly highlight comparable large-scale projects such as the production of the famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/10/black-hole-picture-captured-for-first-time-in-space-breakthrough\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">black hole image</a> that would have seemed impossible not so long ago.

We always use plastic bags,\u201d she recalls being told by neighbours in Eleuthera, one of the 30 inhabited islands in the ocean state. \u201cI had to challenge the mindset that only a certain class of people get to care about this stuff. I told them it is not just for tourists. It\u2019s my island and I want to protect it.\u201d</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Still bigger challenges followed as Ambrose lobbied local politicians to ban single-use plastic and launched an education campaign to inform people about global overconsumption, particularly in rich nations, that contributed to the steady <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-41866046\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">accumulation of rubbish</a> on formerly pristine beaches, coral reefs and stretches of sea in the Caribbean.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIn the Bahamas, it\u2019s a really big deal because we receive the world\u2019s waste as well as producing our own,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is paradise, until you look closely. Then you see the plastic pollution that washes in with the Sargasso Sea.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The 30-year-old marine biologist first became concerned about the issue a decade ago when she had to extricate plastic that had been swallowed by a sea turtle. The traumatic operation took two days and left her with a conviction that she would never drop waste on the ground again. At the age of 22, she was invited on an expedition to study the Pacific Ocean, where she sailed through the vast mass of marine and household debris known as the western garbage patch. This brought home how individual consumer habits had global environmental consequences. A short while later she began the campaign that was to become the <a href=\"https://www.bahamasplasticmovement.org/donate\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Bahamas Plastic Movement.</a></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The first task was raising awareness, first among her own community and then in the corridors of power in Nassau. For a young, working-class black woman from a distant island that was a challenge.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The Bahamas did not gain independence from Britain until 1973 and was long governed by a white minority. Inequality and elitism remain a huge problem, which has affected perceptions of responsibility for nature stewardship.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cMost environmentalists in the Bahamas have been from the elite class. They came from wealthy families that had the privilege of doing marine work because they had big yachts and went to boarding school. In the Bahamas most people are black, but the wealthy people are white, and most environmentalists have been white people,\u201d said Eric Carey, executive director of the Bahamas National Trust.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Ambrose refused to accept this. In recent years, campaigns for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/18/environmental-justice-means-racial-justice-say-activists\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">environmental justice</a> increasingly go hand in hand with the struggle for economic and racial equality. While wealthy countries and older white individuals are often the main cause of waste, pollution and climate instability, the worst consequences tend to be concentrated among communities that are poor, young and black.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Ambrose started her campaign close to home and among the young, before branching out to address the structural and political causes of the plastic problem. For local children she organised a Junior Plastic Warriors environmental education programme with music, dance, and art activities. For teenagers she focused on recycling and staged a \u201ctrashion fashion show\u201d. Pre-dating the global upsurge in youth activism initiated by Greta Thunberg, she led a group to Nassau in early 2018 who banged desks and chanted demands for the environment minister to ban single-use plastics. Several nations in the Caribbean had already implemented similar restrictions. Ambrose was invited to help draft the law for the Bahamas, which came into place this year.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Her achievement was recognised on Monday when she was awarded the prestigious Goldman environmental prize, which is given each year to activists in each of the world\u2019s six inhabited continents.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">For the third year in a row, the majority of the winners are women \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/23/unprecedented-win-for-women-in-top-global-environment-awards-goldman-prize\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">strengthening trend </a>in the prize\u2019s 30-year history.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Ambrose\u2019s selection highlights the growing power of youth activism and increased fears about ocean plastic, while other choices reflected the increased prominence of campaigns against coal and oil and or in favour of indigenous rights.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Anti-fossi fuel activists won three of the six awards. In Africa, the winner was Chibeze Ezekiel, whose four-year grassroots campaign in Ghana succeeded in blocking the country\u2019s first coal power plant and prompted the government to commit to a renewable energy future.

Her death coincided with one of the worst air pollution surges in her local area.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The coroner for the inner south district of greater London will examine potential failings by government authorities to take adequate steps to reduce air pollution and to provide public information about the risks from toxic air, as well as the extent to which any state failing contributed to Ella\u2019s death. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/21/high-court-rules-uk-air-pollution-plans-unlawful\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Ministers have repeatedly failed </a>to bring air pollution from traffic within legal limits, for which they have been censured by judges several times.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Speaking before the hearing, Rosamund Kissi-Debrah said: \u201cIt\u2019s coming up to eight years since Ella passed and it\u2019s been a long, hard fight to get this inquest, with challenges along the way.

Shapely, upright ears. Like humans, pigs have idiosyncratic faces, and new players in the Chinese pork market are taking notice, experimenting with increasingly sophisticated versions of facial recognition software for pigs.</span></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">China is the world\u2019s largest exporter of pork, and is set to increase production next year by 9%. As the nation\u2019s pork farms <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/china-swinefever-muyuanfoods/flush-with-cash-chinese-hog-producer-builds-worlds-largest-pig-farm-idUKL4N2I50W0\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">grow in scale</a>, more farmers are turning to AI systems like facial recognition technology \u2013 known as FRT \u2013 to continuously monitor, identify, and even feed their herds.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This automated style of farming has the potential to be safer, cheaper and generally more effective: In 2018, pig farmers in China\u2019s Guangxi province trialling FRT found that it slashed costs, cut down on breeding time, and improved welfare outcomes for the pigs themselves. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But it also has the potential to leave behind independent, small-scale farmers, who cannot afford to introduce this kind of technology to their operations.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">As one Guangxi-based farmer told the Guardian<em>, </em>FRT just isn\u2019t an option for many farmers.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cFarms with less than a hundred pigs, they can\u2019t afford to track the [pigs\u2019] faces,\u201d he says.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">FRT is able to differentiate between pigs by analysing their snouts, ears, and eyes. The system used in Guangxi farms constantly tracks pigs\u2019 pulses and sweat rates; at the same time, voice recognition software monitors individual animals\u2019 cough rates. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In this way, it is able to spot warning signs before a pig becomes sick or hungry. Being a \u201chighly expressive\u201d animal, the cameras are even capable of recognising distress in the animals\u2019 faces.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIf they are not happy and not eating well, in some cases, you can predict whether the pig is sick,\u201d said Jackson He, the CEO of Yingzi Technologies, which developed the software.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Yingzi is one of a handful of startups revolutionising the country\u2019s $70bn (\u00a352bn) pork industry. It comes after a turbulent two years that has seen China\u2019s pig industry devastated by outbreaks of the African swine flu, leading to the death of 40% of the country\u2019s pigs.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A more hi-tech pork industry with a smaller number of much larger firms is at the heart of the state response to the disaster.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">At a Yingzi farm, surveillance cameras are linked to feed dispensers \u2013 allowing the system to administer individualised feeding plans.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Farmers are also sent personalised notifications through an app, allowing them to adjust rations manually if they so choose. All this makes for a more hands-off relationship between farmer and pig \u2013 but the technology also allows farmers to be more efficient. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">By tracking pigs from birth to slaughter, firms like Yingzi can build up a database of information on each animal\u2019s growth rate. This allows farmers to cut down on wasted food by as much as 20%, with the FRT system optimising the amount of food served to each animal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Precision livestock farming (PLF), as this sort of self-calibrating system is widely known, is helping to beef up bottom lines at farms around the country \u2013 and not simply by limiting waste. Over time, data taken from thousands of pigs has allowed Yingzi and its competitors to constantly refine these algorithms. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The right balance of nutrients, at the right stage of the growth or estrous cycle, can cut the breeding cycle down by as much as two weeks, according to one company insider, and can even improve pork quality and taste.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In a country home to more than half the world\u2019s pigs, it\u2019s unsurprising that the advent of FRT farming has proved a major moneymaker. Last year, Yingzi rolled out its Future Pig Farm system to hundreds of farms across southeastern China, which allowed individual farmers to cut rearing costs by anywhere from 30% to 50%, according to farmers who spoke to the Guardian.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">One of Yingzhi\u2019s biggest competitors \u2013 JingQiShen Organic Agriculture \u2013 has installed its version of FRT at more than 200 pig houses, which together are capable of producing 200,000 animals a year. Over the next three years, it hopes to have 3 million pigs covered by FRT<strong> \u2013 </strong>largely across swathes of China\u2019s snowy northeast.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">British machine learning expert Prof Mark Hansen says this new type of farming is \u201ccertainly more humane\u201d than traditional methods. He mentions that FRT replaces the need to tag pigs\u2019 ears with cast-iron RFID clips; it also marks a shift from reactive to proactive healthcare. Hansen describes the success of firms like Yingzi as a \u201cwin-win\u201d for both pigs and farmers.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But the benefits of FRT are not likely to reach every farmer. Chen Haokai, one of the cofounders of intelligent farming startup SmartAHC, estimates that the labour cost of monitoring pigs\u2019 faces hovers around $7 per pig \u2013 as opposed to traditional tagging, which he says costs about $0.30 per pig. Additionally, fixed installation costs such as a central database and cloud infrastructure can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">If these developments prove to be too expensive for small-scale farmers, it will probably further concentrate agricultural capital in the hands of just a few. In the 1980s and 90s, around 80% of pork made its way on to Chinese plates from small back yard farms \u2013 by 2018, that balance had flipped, with 80% coming from farms with 500 or more animals.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Indeed, FRT has attracted the interest of some of the country\u2019s biggest corporations. Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com, and Netease have all opened subsidiaries and moved into the agricultural space for the first time. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Large-scale farms, backed by investment corporations interested in expanding into the agricultural sector, will probably continue to reap the rewards of these new technologies, leaving small-scale farmers struggling to compete.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Many of the biggest industrial pork producers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/african-swine-fever-destroying-small-pig-farms-as-factory-farming-booms-report\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">posted record profits</a> during the outbreak.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">While it may be making pork farming both more humane and more profitable, itis unclear whether China\u2019s headrush into this new remote, hi-tech style will benefit its rural population. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, FRT firms have focused on improving on their intelligent farming technology, rather than choosing to make it more accessible; in May, Yingzi updated its 3D Pig Farming App, a remote-control VR platform which, according to CEO Jackson He, makes the management of pig farms more akin to \u201cplaying games\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><em>Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/animals-farmed/2018/feb/21/animals-farmed-join-us-for-monthly-updates-newsletter-updates\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Animals farmed monthly update</a> to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

The government says Australia is on track to meet the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for 2030 it set as part of the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Paris climate agreement</a>. Cue the page one headlines, the fireworks, the \u201cmission accomplished\u201d banner on the deck of USS Abraham Lincoln.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Or something like that. You could certainly be left with the impression the Morrison government had achieved something meaningful following the release of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/10/projections-suggest-australia-could-meet-2030-emissions-target-without-using-kyoto-credits\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">annual official emissions projections data</a> on Thursday.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">As usual, the government\u2019s media management was highly skilled, and some political reporters were captured by it. It got its message out. But the reality of what <a href=\"https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/australias-emissions-projections-2020\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">the document</a> says is more complicated.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The first thing to stress here is in the title \u2013 these are only projections. The report tells us what we might expect to happen under current policy settings. It is frankly weird the primacy projections have been given in public debate, given what matters is actual cuts. And things will definitely change in the years ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In terms of the actual numbers, the bottom line is that \u2013 at a time when other countries are announcing increasingly ambitious targets \u2013 the government expects national emissions to fall by only 6.8% this decade.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">That projected drop is almost entirely due to a surge in electricity production from wind and solar that the Morrison government has tried to slow, not accelerate. In most other areas of the economy the projections suggest there will be no change in emissions over the next decade, or they will go up.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The report breaks down the numbers in several ways, but the key point it makes is that the country is more likely to be on track to hit its 2030 target (a 26%-28% cut compared with 2005 levels) than it was a year ago.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Back then, the projection was that emissions would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/07/coalition-claims-it-will-meet-paris-climate-targets-but-only-by-using-accounting-loophole\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">just 16% below 2005 levels by 2030</a> \u2013 more or less where they are now, and well short of the 2030 goal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The update says we are now likely to be at 22% below 2005 levels at the end of the decade \u2013 better in relative terms, though still not at the target and far short of what <a href=\"https://www.climatechangeauthority.gov.au/reviews/targets-and-progress-review-3\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">every</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/immense-potential-of-renewable-energy-could-propel-australia-to-net-zero-2050-target\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">scientific</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/09/not-going-to-get-invited-climate-summit-hosts-unlikely-to-give-scott-morrison-a-speaking-slot\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">diplomatic</a> assessment says we should be doing.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Despite the shortfall, the government issued <a href=\"https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/taylor/media-releases/projections-confirm-australia-track-meet-and-beat-2030-target\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">a press release</a> spinning the projections as confirmation Australia is \u201con track to meet and beat\u201d its 2030 target. It makes this case in two ways. Both require leaps of logic.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The first relates to the much-discussed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/11/rebound-in-carbon-emissions-expected-in-2021-after-fall-caused-by-covid\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">\u201ccarryover credits\u201d</a> from the Kyoto protocol, which Scott Morrison has repeatedly suggested the government could use, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/20/scott-morrison-signals-retreat-on-using-carryover-credits-to-meet-emissions-targets\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">but now probably won\u2019t</a>, to meet its 2030 target. Despite the rhetoric, the projections report assumes they will be available and could kick the country over the line.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The level of chutzpah here is too often ignored. The government claims to have \u201cover-achieved\u201d on the unambitious emissions targets Australia set for itself under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/kyoto-protocol\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Kyoto protocol</a>, the initial international climate pact that expires this year, and should be able to claim credit for that against its Paris agreement target, an entirely different deal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Many of these credits come from the first period of Kyoto protocol, which covered the years 1990 to 2012, when the Howard government set itself a target that allowed Australia to actually raise its emissions by 8%.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Morrison and his emissions reduction minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/angus-taylor\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Angus Taylor</a>, are arguing that Australia deserves a reward in 2030 for beating a goal that allowed it to increase carbon pollution two decades ago. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Not surprisingly, much of the international community <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/16/un-climate-talks-australia-accused-of-cheating-and-thwarting-global-deal\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">sees this as a bad joke</a>, and told the government it wasn\u2019t going to fly at a summit in Madrid last year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/22/australia-is-the-only-country-using-carryover-climate-credits-officials-admit\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">No other country</a> is trying to use this type of Kyoto credits, and the commitment under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Paris deal</a> was to ratchet up emissions cuts, not find ways to avoid them.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The report also suggests the government may be on track to meet its target if it factors in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/22/morrisons-tech-roadmap-flags-more-investment-in-carbon-capture-and-storage\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">technology investment roadmap</a>, a policy it rolled out earlier this year. Put that in, the report says, and we are actually on track for a 29% cut by 2030.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">It is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/23/by-2020-standards-angus-taylors-low-emissions-technology-statement-is-not-really-a-climate-policy\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">entirely unclear what the basis for this is</a>. Perhaps there is modelling somewhere to explain this, but we haven\u2019t seen it and experts in the field say it is hard to see how there could be. A <a href=\"https://www.industry.gov.au/sites/default/files/September%202020/document/first-low-emissions-technology-statement-2020.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">low-emissions technology statement</a> released in September sets \u201cstretch goals\u201d to lower the cost of five \u201cclean\u201d technologies, but says nothing about a timeframe or an emissions reduction plan over the next decade.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The independent analysts at RepuTex were among those to say they could see no justification for the government claiming the roadmap would deliver any emissions cuts in the short-term.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Beyond the claims about targets, it is worth examining more closely why the emissions outlook has improved since last year, when so little action is expected in the years ahead.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The short answer is that government officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/29/scott-morrisons-climate-language-has-shifted-but-actions-speak-louder-than-words\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">have routinely overestimated what national emissions will be</a>, particularly from electricity, as they have failed to appreciate how quickly wind and solar would be taken up.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">It means that almost every year projections of future emissions come down, making it appear easier to meet targets \u2013 not necessarily because governments have done anything, but because the modelling is catching up with reality.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A cynic might say this serves the Coalition\u2019s purposes. At times, it has been used to create the impression of action where little existed.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Taylor says the government is now on track to meet its 2030 goal largely due to $5.3bn in funding announced in the past two budgets, including some topping up for climate agencies that were running low.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The report tells a different story. It says emissions from the power grid are expected to fall 35% over the next decade, and that the country is projected to get 50% of electricity from clean sources by 2030.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The idea the Morrison government deserves credit for this might politely be described as a stretch.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">While the commonwealth is helping pay for some improvements in transmission and backing some energy storage projects, the clean energy influx is mainly due to three things: the now-filled 2020 national renewable energy target; the plunging cost of solar panels; and the growing number of state-based schemes.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The federal Coalition has nothing to do with the last two, and actively worked against the first.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Under Tony Abbott, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/06/tony-abbott-launching-a-full-frontal-attack-on-renewable-energy-industry\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">looked at abolishing the large-scale renewable energy target</a> and found it couldn\u2019t, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/11/tony-abbotts-boast-of-wind-farm-cuts-contradicts-earlier-stand-on-renewables\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">ended up reducing it</a>. Once the target was met last year it chose not to extend or replace it, prompting the states to take a greater role in accelerating solar and wind energy.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Its resistance to the rise of clean energy goes further than just vacating the field. Before the last election, Taylor accused federal Labor of planning to put<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/22/bill-shorten-reveals-15bn-energy-plan-to-help-tackle-climate-disaster\" data-link-name=\"in body link\"> \u201ca wrecking ball through the economy\u201d</a> with climate policies that included what now appears a modest goal of reaching 50% renewable energy by 2030, and the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/08/federal-coalition-mps-raise-fresh-concerns-about-nsw-clean-energy-commitment\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">continues to raise concerns</a> about the ambitious Victorian and NSW renewable schemes.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Meanwhile, it claims the emissions cuts the transformation will drive as its own success.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Projections of emissions from electricity are likely to come down even further next year, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/30/nsws-clean-energy-plan-means-the-federal-government-is-even-more-isolated-on-fossil-fuels\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">NSW\u2019s massive 12 gigawatt clean energy underwriting program</a>, which passed the state parliament last month, is properly factored in.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">At the moment, for reasons that are unclear, the projections assume the growth in renewables will skyrocket over the next five years and then slow after 2025. If the NSW plan is delivered as promised it should effectively build the equivalent of Australia\u2019s current renewable fleet in 10 years \u2013 more than enough to put the Morrison government\u2019s 2030 climate target genuinely within reach.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">It will be interesting to see if federal Coalition MPs are still criticising the state scheme when that happens. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">While renewable energy is projected to continue to grow, the reason the Morrison government isn\u2019t on track to meet its 2030 target yet is, well, everything else.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Emissions from transport, stationary energy (basically, fossil fuels in industry other than electricity and transport), fugitives released during coal and gas extraction and agriculture are all projected to flatline or increase over the next decade.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This isn\u2019t surprising \u2013 the Morrison government is yet to enact significant policies to deal with any of them.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">While transport emissions have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/30/australias-emissions-fell-3-in-year-to-june-amid-covid-shutdown\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">fallen during the Covid-19 pandemic</a>, they are expected to increase to historic highs in the years ahead, largely because the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/22/well-be-left-behind-australias-electric-car-inertia-is-getting-it-nowhere\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">no plan to support the uptake of clean cars</a> in the way comparable countries have.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Transport is only part of the issue. If you remove the electricity sector from the equation, Australia\u2019s scorecard is ugly. Climate Analytics calculated that the combined emissions output from the rest of the economy is projected to be 13% higher in 2030 than 2005.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Given electricity is only about a third of national emissions, this is a major problem. It leaves the country miles away from the government\u2019s claimed goal of one day reaching net zero emissions, and with no path to get there.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This is what the rest of the world sees.

In 1941, the United States Grazing Service, precursor to the BLM\u201a was moved to Salt Lake City; in the 1990s, the BLM moved all its wildfire and aviation staff to Boise, Idaho. But both times, the agency wound up back in Washington.</p>", "<p>This time, the administration chose Grand Junction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" class=\"u-underline\">Colorado</a>, a city of 60,000 located at the western edge of the state. Only 27 high-level jobs will be located at the new headquarters; some 300 are being scattered among state and field offices throughout the west. A small number of jobs, mostly related to Freedom of Information Act requests and budget, will remain in Washington. The move is now under way; the agency\u2019s Washington DC lease expires at the end of this month.</p>", "<p>The announcement quickly generated controversy. Opponents see the move as an attempt to undermine the agency, especially its environmental mandate. They point out that 95% of BLM staff already work in the west, and that those responsible for the move \u2013 Zinke, the current interior secretary, David Bernhardt, and the acting BLM director, William Perry Pendley \u2013 all have anti-public lands track records. (Pendley, who has been serving unlawfully as BLM director, said as recently as 2016 that he thought public lands should be sold off.)</p>", "<p>Congresswomen Jennifer Wexton and Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced legislation to block the move. And environmental organizations raised concerns that relocating to Grand Junction, a major natural gas development area, will bring the agency closer to the oil and gas industry: indeed, Chevron and the Colorado Oil and Gas Association both have offices in the same building as the new BLM headquarters. Some expect that the Biden administration will even reverse the move.</p>", "<p>The issue of accessibility that supposedly animated the agency\u2019s decision to move, however, got lost in the controversy. Ranchers, some of the constituents with whom the agency works most closely, are divided on the BLM\u2019s move \u201cto the field\u201d. Some are enthusiastic about the possibility of a more approachable, and more western agency; other argue that it will make the agency too isolated.</p>", "<p>Whether Grand Junction is more accessible to constituents, for instance, depends on where in the US west they are. Grand Junction is \u201cdarn hard to get to\u201d, as one rancher put it. Four hours from Denver and five from Salt Lake City, the city has a small regional airport with service only to a handful of major US cities. On top of that I-70, the interstate that passes through Grand Junction and connects it to Denver, often closes in the winter because of snowstorms.</p>", "<p>\u201cYou could have made a case for Denver \u2013 you can fly there from Bozeman, Montana or Rock Springs, Wyoming,\u201d says Hillary Proctor, who works with her husband on a ranch in Saratoga, Wyoming. Proctor points out that the issue of isolation is not only about access, but also the agency doing its job. \u201cIf you moved all the natural resources agencies, they could talk to each other. But the BLM got stuck by itself in the middle of nowhere. It\u2019s hard not to see the move as an effort to stifle the agency.\u201d</p>", "<p>Ranchers don\u2019t tend to go all the way to Washington to meet solely with the BLM, either; when the agency was headquartered in the nation\u2019s capital, ranchers who made the trip out east could take the opportunity to meet with senators and representatives, lobbyists and other land and resource management agencies. Issues that merit a trip to Washington \u2013 such as endangered species management or \u201csplit estates\u201d (in which ranchers hold surface rights to their land but not the minerals below it, which may be federal and leased to resource development companies) \u2013 have many stakeholders.</p>", "<p>\u201cIf we go to DC we can visit with many more people who are decision-makers. We can talk to people in the House and Senate. We can speak to committees and staffers. But if we go to Grand Junction, we can maybe talk to one or two BLM employees \u2026 my guess is we won\u2019t be really effecting any change,\u201d says Jeanie Alderson, a rancher in Birney, Montana.</p>", "<p>Yet Tom Page, who holds a BLM permit for cattle grazing in Hailey, Idaho, remains cautiously optimistic.</p>", "<p>\u201cThose BLM folks in their castles in DC are hard to meet and talk to,\u201d he says. \u201cI would much rather go to Grand Junction.\u201d Page sees the move as a consequence of the general adriftness and low morale in the agency over the last four years.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe lack of leadership over the last four years has trickled down to the state and field offices,\u201d Page says, referring to what he says as increasingly high turnover rates among BLM officials in recent years. \u201cWe\u2019ve had four range-cons [conservation specialists] in the last few years, and three field office managers.\u201d Page argues that this attrition has hampered the BLM\u2019s ability to effectively serve its constituents. \u201cHow do you write a complicated permit in that situation? That kind of turnover is hard for ranchers because they\u2019re here their whole life.\u201d</p>", "<p>Though both he and Proctor expect that the BLM\u2019s headquarters move will increase this attrition and loss of institutional knowledge, Page sees it as a short-term challenge. Over time, he believes ranchers will benefit from having the headquarters closer to the field. Proctor hopes he is right.</p>", "<p>\u201cI would love to be wrong, because I want to see good decisions for people and for conservation. I want public lands to thrive.\u201d</p>", "<p>This article was amended on 14 December 2020 to clarify that Hailey, Idaho is a city rather than a county. </p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["PA Media"], "tags": ["Environment,Air pollution,London,UK news"], "title": ["Ella Kissi-Debrah's mother says she wants justice for her daughter"], "date": ["2020-12-11T13:54:47.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p>Inquest is considering whether London air pollution contributed to nine-year-old\u2019s asthma death</p>", "<p class=\"css-vdb1rb\">Last modified on Fri 11 Dec 2020 17.54 GMT</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The mother of a girl who suffered a fatal asthma attack thought to have been triggered by air pollution has said she wants \u201cjustice\u201d for her daughter.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Nine-year-old Ella Kissi-Debrah died in February 2013 having suffered numerous seizures and having made almost 30 hospital visits over the previous three years.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">An inquest at Southwark coroner\u2019s court is considering whether dangerous levels of air pollutants around her home may have contributed to her death.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">She had lived 25 metres from the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south-east <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">London</a> \u2013 one of the capital\u2019s busiest roads.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Speaking at the end of the final day of inquest hearings on Friday, Ella\u2019s mother, Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, said she hoped the conclusion would have a positive impact on other children\u2019s lives.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">She said: \u201cI am very tired.

Plenty of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259019821930017X\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">studies have shown</a> that e-bike users often get as much life-enhancing physical activity as riders of conventional bikes, with the lower exertion often factored out by more miles ridden.</p>", "<p>Finally, e-bikes can be transformative, especially for those uncertain that cycling or cycle commuting is for them, whether because of a lack of experience, or because of hills, or perhaps fitness.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Enough preamble; let\u2019s get to the reviews.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This innovative Dutch company is so convinced by the prospects for e-bike travel that it has stopped making conventional bikes altogether, though the distinctive frame design remains, with front and rear lights in the crossbar tube.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In fact, pretty much everything is built into the frame, including the battery and motor, meaning fellow cyclists at red lights might not even realise what you\u2019re riding until you shoot into the distance with a gentle whirring noise.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">At least by e-bike standards, the S3 is not hugely expensive, but the feel is very hi-tech and high-end. Rather than a clunky bolted-to-the-handlebar display, a digital readout in the crossbar gives you the speed and battery life. An associated app lets you vary the automatic gears. Even the bell is electronic, with an app-selected choice of noise.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">To ride, the S3 is genuinely fantastic. The motor power, which comes via the cranks rather than direct to a wheel, is smooth and gradual, without the sudden jolt that some older e-bikes used to give when you hit 15mph.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In fact, the bike initially felt almost unnervingly nippy, until I realised the last test rider had left the app switched to US settings, meaning the electric power stayed on up to 20mph, the legal limit there. This is actually a bit worrying, as to use the bike in the UK like this would be illegal. I\u2019m told VanMoof now don\u2019t allow UK users to switch modes.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">If you have the budget for a VanMoof, a lot of it will come down to its quirks. For example, the fully integrated battery looks very slick. But it can\u2019t be removed, so if, like me, you live in a flat and keep bikes in a garage without electric power, it makes the S3 slightly pointless.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Similarly, some of the techy features felt a bit solution-in-search-of-a-problem. I endlessly fiddled with the ratios for the four-speed automatic gears, but could never find a range that even approximated how I\u2019d want to change manually. Even the two electronic bell noises were a bit too abrasive for my tastes.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But others will, and do, disagree. The VanMoof was definitely the bike that prompted the most interest and envy from neighbours and fellow riders, and if the design suits you, it is a delight to ride.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In terms of commuting practicality, the S3 comes with full mudguards and a chair guard, and VanMoof makes its own front and rear racks, with branded pannier bags to go on them.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">I had hoped to try the same-priced commuter model in Halfords\u2019 own-brand range, or a slightly cheaper folding version. But if e-bikes are in short supply, then (relatively) cheap ones are like gold dust, so I tried out the mountain bike.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Though officially designed for hills and trails, it is still quite commuter-friendly, with eyelets for mudguards and a rear rack, while the wide tyres and suspension forks laugh in the face of bumpy surfaces.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Not so long ago, cheaper e-bikes could be jerky and jolting, but the Vengeance is enormous fun, and handles with surprising nimbleness. At 23kg, it is undeniably something of a beast, but the electric motor hauls you up inclines with ease. I even tried riding it, motor-less, up one steep hill, and while I wouldn\u2019t call it fun, it wasn\u2019t impossible.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">On picking up the bike, I had worried whether its brakes \u2013 cable-operated disc models, as against the VanMoof\u2019s hydraulic versions \u2013 might be a bit weedy against such bulk, but they were fine.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The main journey I took was a 20-plus-mile cross-London round trip to see a friend, on a day of constantly pouring rain, and it was a great illustration of the benefits of an e-bike. Even dressed in trawlerman-style waterproofs, there was no chance of overly sweating, while the sheer bulk of the bike mitigated against skittish handling.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Guided by a phone app along a complex route of back streets and low-traffic neighbourhoods, I found it almost relaxing. Yes, I could have done the trip on my normal bike, but the chances are I wouldn\u2019t have bothered.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The contrast between the VanMoof and the Brompton is perhaps best exemplified by their bells. While the former gave me the choice between two highly audible if grating electronic beeps, the Brompton\u2019s small, highly polished bell produces the equivalent of a frock-coated butler politely clearing his throat.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">To continue the parallel, if the VanMoof has everything sleekly integrated, the e-Brompton is basically a standard model with a motor hub and battery pack added to the front.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This is perhaps unfair. The electrification is both neat and elegant, with the front-wheel mounting allowing the bike to completely fold in the normal Brompton way. The battery comes in an elegant bag that clips to the front, and can be removed with a click and then carried.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Wheel-drive e-bikes used to sometimes feel a bit clunky, but the Brompton is ultra-smooth, and hugely nippy in full-power mode (the only one I ever use for e-bikes, I have to confess), and is very manageable to ride on zero power, even with the minimalist two-gear system.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">As with all Bromptons, much depends on whether you need a folding bike. One extra advantage here is that e-bikes are very stealable, and with a Brompton you can safely keep it inside, at home or in an office.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But then, of course, comes the price. Even the cheapest manual Brompton leaves minimal change from \u00a3800, but an extra \u00a32,000 might feel a lot for that electric assist, however well engineered. However, Brompton fans tend to be loyal, so for those who can afford it, this could be a price worth paying.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">If the other bikes I tried all had their quirks, or niches, perhaps the best thing you can say about the Motus is that it is gloriously ordinary \u2013 a very sensible and well-fitted commuter bike that just happens to have an electric motor.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">With full mudguards, a chainguard and rack, sensible, swept-back handlebars, and even a kick stand, this is a bike for getting around town efficiently and without drama. On a conventional commuter bike, suspension forks tend to be a weighty irrelevance, but here they helped make the ride even smoother.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">None of this is to say the bike is dull. Particularly if you\u2019ve never tried one, riding an e-bike is one of the most instantly grin-inducing things you can do on two wheels, and the Motus is zippy, smooth and enormous fun, even though it is no slimline machine, weighing in at about the same as the Carrera.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Whereas some might feel baffled by the VanMoof\u2019s app-adjusted inner workings, the Motus is a very obviously a conventional bike, with standard derailleur gears and no-fuss hydraulic discs. The electrics are controlled via a straightforward handlebar display.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">One thing I\u2019ve not mentioned for any of the bikes is range, in part as this depends on so many factors, including what power setting you use, how much you pedal yourself, rider weight, and terrain.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But e-bikes increasingly only need to be charged every few days, even once a week, as opposed to the range-anxiety-inducing creatures of before. The Raleigh claims a standard range of 76 miles, which is more than enough for a week of commuting for most people.</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/claire-stares"], "tags": ["Birds,Environment,Rural affairs,UK news,Animals,World news,Wildlife,Winter"], "title": ["Country diary: carrion crows become intensely territorial"], "date": ["2020-12-11T05:30:19.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p><strong>Langstone, Hampshire:</strong> The most plausible explanation for this attack was resource competition, the crows asserting their dominance to ensure priority access to this prime feeding site</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><span class=\"css-17ehqsd\"><span class=\"css-1ljoi60\">W</span></span><span class=\"css-38z03z\">ith temperatures plummeting over the past few days, the birds and mammals visiting my garden have begun to forage with increased urgency.

Institutional investors \u2013 the big pension funds and other piles of money that provide much of the capital businesses need to operate \u2013 have increasingly turned away from coal and other fossil fuels.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Norway\u2019s Government Pension Fund Global, which at US$1.2tn is so big it holds about 1.5% of all the shares in listed companies in the world, has strict rules forbidding it from investing in companies that produce more than 20m tonnes of thermal coal a year or produce power of more than 10,000MW a year from burning coal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">As a result, in May it excluded from investment two big multinationals that mine coal in Australia, Glencore and Anglo American, as well as Australian power company AGL Energy.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">It also put BHP on notice that it could dump its stake in the Big Australian if it didn\u2019t get out of thermal coal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In Australia, the big banks have displayed an increasing unwillingness to lend to coal, with ANZ in October <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/oct/29/nationals-call-for-anz-boycott-after-banks-push-for-net-zero-emissions\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">saying</a> it would not write new loans to businesses with more than 10% exposure to thermal coal and existing customers with more than 50% exposure would need to show it \u201cspecific, time bound and public diversification strategies\u201d to continue receiving the bank\u2019s cash.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The harder line from banks followed warnings from their regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, that they needed to consider climate risks when making decisions.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Apra member Geoff Summerhayes laid down the regulator\u2019s position in a speech in 2017 that was met with howls of dismay and derision by some.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This week, he said the criticism \u201cwas good impetus for me to actually go harder, because it\u2019s very much a financial risk with real prudential implications\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">It is easy to blame the failure of Australian coal prospects to re-emerge from the pandemic on the situation in China. However, there are growing signals the industry is heading into its final bust cycle.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">A few days before the Dalrymple Bay terminal was floated, the largest coal producer in Australia and the western world, Glencore, released its annual investor update and \u2013 critically \u2013 announced new plans for a <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/glencore-takes-axe-to-coal-targets-but-says-australia-will-be-spared-20201208-p56lmy.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">\u201cmanaged decline of its coal business\u201d</a> and net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">While those plans are ultimately long-term (and also play to the company\u2019s strategic interest by seeking to keep prices at viable levels by constraining supply) they also show the company expects volumes to drop substantially \u2013 up to 20% \u2013 in the next few years, compared to previous projections.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The same investor update last year envisaged Glencore would produce 140m tonnes of coal in 2022. Now the company only expects to mine 115m tonnes that year. It might consider mine-life extension projects but has no plans to develop new coal mines.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Coal is also on the nose at Australia\u2019s two big mining companies, BHP and Rio Tinto, which have turned away from the black rock and towards red ones as the iron ore price continues to soar.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Rio Tinto sold its last Australian coal mine in 2018 and, under pressure from investors, BHP has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/18/bhp-commits-to-selling-its-thermal-coal-mines-within-two-years\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">promised</a> to get out of thermal coal \u2013 burned in power plants \u2013 within two years but so far has found no buyers.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Of particular concern to miners in Queensland is the way financial markets have treated metallurgical (or coking) coal, which is used in steelmaking. More than 80% of the exports from Dalrymple Bay are metallurgical coal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In the days before the DBI float, company chief executive Anthony Timbrell <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/chanticleer/why-the-dalrymple-bay-float-says-coal-ain-t-coal-20201205-p56kx0\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">told the Australian Financial Review</a> it would seek to emphasise the difference between metallurgical and thermal (energy producing) coal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cI guess it\u2019s our job to draw out that story and remind people of the complexity,\u201d Timbrell said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Thermal coal is the primary target of environmental activists; while metallurgical coal is less susceptible in the immediate-term to a global energy pivot towards renewables.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">BHP has also been keen to draw the distinction, which is in its financial interests as metallurgical coal attracts a higher price than thermal coal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">However, as excitement builds around the prospect of (as yet, not commercialised) steelmaking alternatives like green hydrogen, the financial markets increasingly appear to be making little differentiation between the classes of coal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Buckley points to a graph comparing the US and Australian metallurgical coal producer Coronado with Australian company Whitehaven, which largely mines thermal coal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Since Coronado was listed in 2018, both Coronado and Whitehaven\u2019s shares have dived almost in harmony by about 65%. The All Ordinaries is up about 20% over the same period.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe financial markets are no longer really differentiating between coking coal and thermal coal,\u201d Buckley said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cDalrymple Bay is a really interesting bellwether for Queensland. Having already been priced down, having failed to get institutional support, taxpayers effectively did a bailout.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe vendor (Brookfield Asset Management) is the most successful investor in energy infrastructure, and you don\u2019t buy from the most successful energy investor in the world and think you\u2019re getting a bargain.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThis isn\u2019t a resources sector problem either, this is a coal problem. The Australian resource sector is having the best year in history, iron ore prices are at phenomenal highs. It\u2019s the fossil fuel sector that\u2019s on its knees.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The coal company run by John Canavan, the brother of Queensland senator Matt Canavan, went under earlier this month.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The company, ICRA Rolleston, is a junior joint venture partner with Glencore in the Rolleston thermal coal mine in Queensland. Glencore will continue to operate the mine but a court case finalised last month showed how the collapse in the coal price had turned the mine into a loss-making venture.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">John Canavan\u2019s share of the mine\u2019s costs were about $14m more than sales revenue in August. Glencore expected another $4m shortfall by the end of the year.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The Queensland Exploration Council (an offshoot of the Resources Council) this week released a report card showing some growth in spending by coal speculators during 2019-20 and said there was \u201cdefinitely a feeling of growth and optimism in the sector\u201d. In the detail of its report, though, for the first time in four years the QEC downgraded its view on coal prices, saying these has become \u201ccause for concern\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In its prospectus for potential investors, DBI warned about a series of \u201crisks\u201d that included its customers collapsing due to low coal prices, or long-term decline in global coal demand.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Its most significant new investor, the Queensland government, released a study in September that stated \u201cthere is a substantial degree of uncertainty\u201d about assumptions used to underpin long-term market projections, including about the price of coking coal.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cQueensland Treasury\u2019s analysis \u2026 highlights that Queensland\u2019s future coal demand will continue to be primarily linked to key economies in north-east and south-east Asia. In particular, the future demand for Queensland\u2019s metallurgical coal likely hinges on demand from the world\u2019s two largest coal consumers, China and India.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">DBI\u2019s warnings included that ongoing political tensions between Australia and China could ultimately result in a decline in coal exports from the port.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cDemand for metallurgical coal \u2026 or coal generally may reduce over a period of time due to a variety of reasons, including reduced demand from key coal export markets, such as China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korean and India.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In addition to China\u2019s import restrictions, China, Japan and South Korea \u2013 Australia\u2019s three largest coal customers \u2013 each announced aggressive pivots towards net zero emissions this year.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Adding to DBI\u2019s troubles is the nature of its business \u2013 where contracts with exporters are regulated by a competition authority. The port\u2019s capacity is fully allocated. Unable to raise prices or attract new customers, its pitch to investors has been about expanding its capacity to grow the business, even as shipments are being shunned by China, export volumes contract, coal companies collapse and other Queensland ports face severe debt problems.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Of those terminals, Wiggins Island at Gladstone and the Abbot Point terminal near Bowen, owned by Adani, have both been operating at well below design capacity for all of this decade, a point Buckley and others say shows any expansion of Dalrymple Bay is not viable.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Abbot Point \u2013 where Adani\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/03/adani-second-major-korean-brokerage-withdraws-financial-backing-for-miners-coal-projects\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">debts are estimated in excess of $1.5bn</a> \u2013 typically has a queue of about three coal ships.

The population near <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Alaska</a> was targeted by commercial whalers beginning in the 1700s for their oil, blubber and baleen. Their large, rotund bodies and slow-moving nature made them easy targets, and they were nearly hunted to extinction by the turn of the 20th century.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Once commercial whaling ceased, the western <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/arctic\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Arctic</a> population living in the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas began to rebound. The whales\u2019 recovery has been in large part thanks to the natural inaccessibility of their ice-covered home, which has shielded them from commercial shipping and fishing activities that threaten their right whale cousins to the south.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">George also credits sustainable management and stewardship of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission (AEWC), who have fought against offshore oil drilling and other activities that could harm the species.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cNo one has fought harder than the AEWC to protect bowhead habitat from industrial development in the US Arctic,\u201d George said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Researchers work with Alaska native communities such as the Inupiat of Utqia\u0121vik, Alaska, who have hunted the whales at sustainable levels for at least 1,000 years, to monitor and study the species. \u201cThe general understanding of cetacean biology, anatomy and physiology and ecology has been greatly enhanced in the partnership with indigenous hunters,\u201d George said. \u201cIt was the Inupiat captains that taught us how to properly count whales.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Bowhead whales can provide broader insights into Arctic marine ecosystem health. The species\u2019 longevity and sensitivity to annual fluctuations help biologists track changes in the Arctic over long periods of time.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Bowhead whales\u2019 accelerated population expansion in recent decades has come as a surprise to biologists, who expected the cold-adapted whale species to suffer from the melting sea ice. Bowheads are highly specialized to their Arctic environment, with a pronounced bump on their heads used to break ice and blubber over a foot and a half (half a meter) thick. So far, however, the whales have proven resilient in the face of dramatic changes and have even benefited in unexpected ways.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The Arctic is becoming more productive as temperatures rise and more light reaches the ocean surface layer where sea ice is thinner or absent. Less ice and more nutrients flowing north from the Bering Sea have led to an increase in bowhead whale foods like krill and copepods in northern latitudes. These changes have been helpful to bowheads around Alaska, resulting in fatter whales and more babies, according to Noaa.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Bowheads have also been able to expand their territory north into waters where the ice was once too thick for them to break. While the western Arctic population was hunted down to just a few thousand individuals by the end of commercial whaling, they had rebounded to about 10,000 individuals by the turn of the 21st century and now number at least 16,800.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But the species\u2019 fate is far from certain as the Arctic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/08/arctic-report-climate-crisis-wildfires-ice-loss\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">rapidly transforms</a>. Their thick blubber, which provides insulation against frigid icy waters, could become a disadvantage during warmer summers. They are also more likely to get tangled in fishing gear, face competition for food from other baleen whales, and attacked by their only natural predators \u2013 orcas \u2013 as the ice retreats and can no longer shield them. \u201cThey really are headed into an uncertain future,\u201d George said.</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["Zoe Kean"], "tags": ["Endangered species,Conservation,Food,Environment,Australia news,Agriculture,World news"], "title": ["In a nutshell: how the macadamia became a 'vulnerable' species"], "date": ["2020-12-12T08:00:33.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p>Australia\u2019s nut trees have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/09/bison-recovering-but-31-other-species-now-extinct-finds-red-list\" data-link-name=\"in standfirst link\">added to the IUCN\u2019s red list</a> of threatened species as numbers in the wild dwindle</p>", "<p class=\"css-vdb1rb\">Last modified on Tue 15 Dec 2020 17.04 GMT</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><span class=\"css-17ehqsd\"><span class=\"css-1ljoi60\">W</span></span><span class=\"css-38z03z\">hen Ian McConachie was growing up in postwar Queensland, his aunt had macadamia nut trees in her back yard. She told him that one day the trees would be famous. More than 70 years later she has been proved right \u2013 the Australian nut is a delicacy prized in kitchens around the world.</span></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But this week the macadamia came to the world\u2019s attention for another reason: <em>Macadamia integrifolia</em>, or the Queensland nut tree,<em> </em>was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/09/bison-recovering-but-31-other-species-now-extinct-finds-red-list\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list of threatened species</a> \u201con account of its population size, suspected at potentially fewer than 1,000 mature individuals\u201d. Its endangered relative, <em>Macadamia ternifolia</em>, has previously been listed on the <a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/7377\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">IUCN red list of threatened plants</a>, as the four macadamia species indigenous to Australia come under significant environmental pressure.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">With a history stretching back millions of years, the macadamia evolved on what is now the Australian continent, where the sub-tropical rainforest trees fed Indigenous people for millennia. Their status as an agricultural crop is relatively new, but, says McConachie, a macadamia grower for more than 40 years who is now working to conserve the nut, \u201cmacadamias are unique because they are one of very few food plants that domesticated in the last couple of thousand years.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The nut began its journey to global popularity in the late 1800s, when a handful of seeds were sent from Australia to Hawaii. By the 1920s, the islands had a thriving macadamia industry, says McConachie. The trees that provided the seeds for the Hawaiian industry are still growing, \u201cthey\u2019re in the wild near Gympie, near where I live\u201d, he says. In 2019 Gympie, a small town in Queensland, was officially identified as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/01/nut-of-note-70-of-worlds-macadamia-come-from-single-australian-tree\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">origin of 70% of the world\u2019s macadamia nuts</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In the 1970s McConachie, then a young food scientist, travelled to Hawaii to learn how to grow macadamias commercially. He became part of a generation of growers that developed the macadamia into Australia\u2019s largest native crop. According to the <a href=\"https://www.australianmacadamias.org/industry/about/about-the-macadamia-industry#:~:text=The%20farm%20gate%20value%20of,up%20%24200million%20of%20that.\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Australian Macadamia Society</a>, there are upwards of 700 growers across three states producing about 50,000 tonnes a year, 70% of which is exported to more than 40 countries.<br><br>The problem for the macadamia is that while cultivated orchards may be extensive, due to widespread use of grafting they are almost genetically uniform, says Dr Catherine Nock, a geneticist at Southern Cross University specialising in macadamias.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cYou can fly over the Northern Rivers of New South Wales and see thousands of macadamia trees, but there will only be about 20 individuals because they are clones of each other,\u201d she says.<br><br>Genetic diversity gives species the tools to tackle new challenges such as disease or a changing climate. The uniformity of macadamia orchards leaves cultivated trees vulnerable. In contrast, wild macadamias are very genetically diverse, so protecting wild trees is critical to the survival of the species, she says.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Over the past 200 years these trees have been anything but protected, says Denise Bond, executive officer at the Macadamia Conservation Trust. The rainforests they live in are \u201cexactly the places that humans like to live [and as a result] 80% of macadamia habitat has been cleared in Queensland \u2013 and in New South Wales they have cleared around 98%\u201d.<br><br>Many of the surviving wild macadamias cling on in fragmented patches of rainforest or grow in people\u2019s yards and paddocks. Fragmentation has made the forest dwellers vulnerable to weeds and fire, while isolated trees are at risk of being cut down during development or having their roots trampled by cattle. The trust is working with the Australian government to implement a <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/recovery-plans/southern-macadamia-species-recovery-plan\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">recovery plan</a> for the nut.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The presence of macadamia orchards poses a threat to the genetic diversity of the wild population, says Nock, because the pollen from the cultivated clones is carried by bees to fertilise nearby wild trees. Young trees are being found in the wild with orchard genetics; effectively it is as if there are four fathers for every 100 mothers. Over generations this could dramatically reduce the genetic diversity of the wild population.<br><br>The push for conservation of the macadamia nut has come from the industry, according to Bond. \u201cThis is quite unusual; usually it\u2019s a group of botanists or conservationists who are concerned about a species,\u201d she says.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Many of the wild ancestors of crops we eat today are now extinct, or have been domesticated for so many thousands of years that their origins are uncertain. \u201cPeople are desperately scrabbling to find these crops\u2019 wild relatives \u2026 whereas in Australia, we\u2019ve got this amazing potential that we\u2019re only a couple of generations from the wild species,\u201d says Bond. \u201cThe wild species are like a gene bank of diversity for future resilience against climate change and any disease or pest outbreaks.\u201d<br><br>The short-term goal for Bond is to save the remnant rainforest pockets where macadamia live. These forests are of immense value, she says, not just for the macadamia but for their biodiversity overall. <br><br>To ensure the long-term survival of macadamia diversity, Nock spends a lot of time in the forest, taking leaf samples for DNA testing. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to find a macadamia tree in the wild unless you know where one has been recorded before,\u201d says Nock. But, after years of working in these lush forests, Nock has developed a nose for them. \u201cI can often pick them up by the scent of their flowers in spring,\u201d she says.<br><br>Cuttings from wild trees and specimens growing on people\u2019s properties are collected and saved. These often find homes in botanic gardens and arboretums where they and their genetic heritage are protected.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">McConachie is now 84 and still active on the macadamia scene. By turns he calls himself \u201cthe industry dinosaur\u201d and \u201ca pioneer\u201d. He recalls fondly a childhood savouring the nuts at Sunday roasts with his aunt, who he credits as his \u201cfirst mentor\u201d. Together they would crack nuts in a vice and serve them with butter and salt.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">He is hopeful that all the conservation work being done by himself, Nock, Bond and their colleagues will conserve wild macadamias into the future.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s terribly important to understand the diversity of wild macadamias to ensure we\u2019ve conserved for all time the genetics that are going to be of value in the future. Not just commercial value, but as part of Australia\u2019s heritage,\u201d he says.<br><br>\u201cIn 100 years\u2019 time, we\u2019ll be getting the benefits of what we\u2019re doing with conservation now.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u2022 This article was amended on 15 December 2020 to clarify that the analogy used of trees having \u201cfour fathers and maybe 100 mothers\u201d was not a direct quote from Dr Nock, as an earlier version had indicated.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stephen-rutt"], "tags": ["Trees and forests,Winter,Environment,Rural affairs,UK news,Fungi,Birds,Animals,UK weather,Scotland,Rivers"], "title": ["Country diary: ice that's hair today, but gone in an instant"], "date": ["2020-12-12T05:30:28.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p><strong>Forest of Ae, Dumfries and Galloway:</strong> Hair ice fits its name perfectly, it is coiffed and has a parting, but as morning sunlight creeps across the river it vanishes</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><span class=\"css-17ehqsd\"><span class=\"css-1ljoi60\">M</span></span><span class=\"css-38z03z\">ist is rising from the Water of Ae, turning gold as the dawn light slips across the valley through <a href=\"https://forestryandland.gov.scot/visit/forest-of-ae\" title data-link-name=\"in body link\">the forest</a> of birch and pine.

Yes, some of the processes used in lithium extraction at the moment are environmentally destructive, and better solutions are needed. But extraction of oil and gas has been environmentally horrific for over a century, going backwards in standards with tar sands and fracking.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Yes, elements used in some battery chemistries (like cobalt) are associated with child labour and human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is completely unacceptable.

killing wildlife including whales, dolphins, turtles and seabirds around the globe, according to a review of hundreds of scientific articles.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Discarded fishing line and nets as well as latex gloves and balloons were also found to be disproportionately lethal when compared with other ocean debris that animals mistakenly eat.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The review, by the Australian government\u2019s science agency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/csiro\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">CSIRO</a>, found ingesting plastic was responsible for killing animals across 80 different species.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Whales, dolphins and turtles were especially at risk from eating plastic film, with seabird deaths linked more with ingestion of hard plastic pieces and balloons.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Nets and lines from the fishing industry were found to be most lethal to seals and sea lions.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cDeath from eating any of these items is not a quick one and it is not likely to be painless,\u201d said marine ecologist Dr Lauren Roman, who led the study. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty awful way to die.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The review, published in the journal <a href=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/conl.12781\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Conservation Letters</a>, analysed 655 scientific articles about marine debris and found 79 studies across all inhabited continents detailing deaths in cetaceans (whales and dolphins), pinnipeds (seals and sea lions), sea turtles and sea birds.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The aim of the study was to understand what kinds of animals were at most risk from the different kinds of debris \u2013 mostly plastic \u2013 that is in the ocean.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In September, a study in the journal Science <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6510/1515\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">estimated that in 2016 between 19m and 23m tonnes </a>of plastic found its way into both rivers and oceans.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Roman said while there was a lot of plastic in the ocean, some types were more harmful than others.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt\u2019s important we don\u2019t conflate the amount of plastic with how deadly it is,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cFor example, microfibres are probably not going to kill a whale, but for the first time we have quantified what\u2019s being eaten, what\u2019s deadly, and then [are going to] see which [of the items] can be controlled through policies.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The most disproportionately lethal item was rubber, but the studies reviewed could not reliably identify where it was coming from.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Flexible plastic that\u2019s used for plastic bags and packaging was found to be especially dangerous because it was both ubiquitous and dangerous.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Roman said: \u201cFlexible plastic can crumple up and get stuck at several points in an animal\u2019s digestive system.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cTypically, it\u2019s neutrally buoyant so you can find it at all sorts of depths in the water column that overlap with places where animals are feeding.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The studies examined in the review had looked at 1,328 deaths of animals, but debris was only clearly identified as the cause of death in 159 animals.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Roman said this lack of data on deaths from marine debris was down to circumstance. Most animals that die are never found by humans.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">For a marine animal death to be able to be studied in detail, it needs to be found by people in a place where the animal can be quickly examined by someone with the right skills.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Knowing the true toll of marine debris on marine mammals was challenging but it was an ongoing question that researchers were trying to answer.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The research also lists the potential policy responses to reduce the number of the deadliest items in the ocean.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The research says: \u201cTo reduce megafauna mortality, we recommend policymakers focus on reduction through regulation, prohibition and replacement of high\u2010mortality-risk large items such as plastic bags, plastic packaging, plastic sheets, fishing rope, nets, tackle and balloons.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cReducing the abundance of these items in the environment would directly reduce mortality of marine megafauna through lesser megafauna\u2013debris encounters and interactions.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Richard Leck, head of oceans at WWF Australia, told the Guardian that global momentum to reduce the use of single-use plastics had been lost through the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">He said: \u201cWe are probably using more plastics now than we were at the start of this year. This study shows us we have to get that momentum back.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember what happens to these animals when they ingest these plastics. It\u2019s a horrible death. When turtles ingest plastic bags they can\u2019t submerge. Marine mammals waste away over weeks and weeks.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Leck said more than 70 countries had so far supported a call for the United Nations to introduce a global treaty to combat plastic pollution.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThis study is another very strong argument for having a global approach to solving this,\u201d said Leck.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In August, a <a href=\"https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-alerts-to-sharp-rise-in-plastic-waste-crime\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">report by the international police organisation Interpol</a> found a rise in the illegal trade of plastic waste since 2018, saying law enforcement around the globe needed to work together to stop illegal movement and dumping of plastic waste.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/06/more-than-14m-tonnes-of-plastic-believed-to-be-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Australian researchers estimated that 14m tonnes of tiny plastic pieces were sitting on the ocean floor</a>, suggesting there was about 30 times as much plastic at the bottom of the ocean than floating on the surface.</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/james-tapper"], "tags": ["Ethical and green living,Environment,Recycling,Christmas,Life and style,Waste,UK news"], "title": ["New generation of Good Lifers set out to grow their own Christmas"], "date": ["2020-12-13T10:00:03.000Z"], "images": ["<img class=\"gu-image\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\" alt=\"Some of Maya Levy\u2019s garden crop.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b928190cdef4335834a7f397ac681fee5e5a553/0_212_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=451a1104be33a2eb711c1ec52c52ba1a\">", "<img class=\"gu-image\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\" alt=\"Dave Goulson\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51ea2b5d19dba4a8f340a1342929784b529f9fca/287_1143_7749_4649/master/7749.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f300ac8b7eb7c8f732092ee34df6de34\">"], "body": ["<p>It\u2019s hard to reuse a chocolate advent calendar, but for Maya Levy it\u2019s one of the best parts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" class=\"u-underline\">Christmas</a>.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really cool \u2013 it\u2019s in the shape of a gingerbread house.

Local people rely on its water for domestic use and farming. Lake Bogoria is alkaline and home to thousands of flamingoes that depend on the blue-green algae thriving in its waters. The hot water geysers and hot springs that used to attract tourists to the region lie buried underneath.</p>", "<p>\u201cShould the two lakes ever merge, fresh water from Baringo would dilute the alkali in Bogoria and reduce the growth of algae,\u201d says Mark Boitt, a geographic information system expert. \u201cSeveral years ago, a similar rise in the waters of Lake Nakuru caused millions of flamingoes to flee the lake for Bogoria. But for how long can they keep on moving? We stand at the threshold of rapid loss of biodiversity around the lakes.\u201d</p>", "<p>Already, the rising water levels in Baringo have affected wild animals residing on the lake\u2019s Longcharo island as the waters reduce the size of the island and the areas for them to forage. In September, wildlife authorities relocated ostriches, impalas and warthogs to a conservancy on the mainland. Earlier this month, two of the eight giraffes marooned on the island were also moved to safety.</p>", "<p>\u201cMoving a giraffe is a delicate process. We have to survey the habitat and make sure we anchor the barge in a manner that makes it easy for the giraffes to enter without causing them unnecessary stress,\u201d says Jackson Komen, a warden for the Kenya <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" class=\"u-underline\">Wildlife</a> Service in Baringo. \u201cIt took a whole day just to move one giraffe, with the barge taking at least two hours to get to the mainland. The remaining ones, including some pregnant females, will be moved a little later.\u201d</p>", "<p>The government has appointed a multi-agency technical committee to <a href=\"http://www.environment.go.ke/?p=8046\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">investigate</a> the cause of rising water levels in the lakes, with the final report due for release in the coming days.</p>", "<p>Silas Simiyu, a local geologist, says human activity around the water catchment areas is a key reason for the rising water levels.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe may be talking of increased water volume but forget that it is the lakes\u2019 capacity to hold water that has reduced. Water from underground aquifers has always risen depending on the tectonic movement cycles. But never have the lakes been silted as they are today,\u201d says Simiyu. \u201cRather than act like deep bowls that can hold more water, the lakes are becoming wide, thin-rimmed pans due to siltation.\u201d</p>", "<p>He says: \u201cSome talk of increased rainfall, but the ongoing rains are not the heaviest to be witnessed in these areas. Let us accept that our own activities have exacerbated the problem.\u201d</p>", "<p>Susan Jepkemoi, an environmental scientist with the Great Rift Centre for Research and Development, says the population increase has come with demand for more farmland, and more people have settled close to the lakes.</p>", "<p>\u201cChange in land use without regard for the environment will have serious climatic consequences on these lakes,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople around the lakes continue to cut down trees for charcoal burning. This depletes the ground cover leading to flooding. The runoff water takes with it the top soil to the lakes, the lowest points in the Rift Valley, and leads to silting.\u201d</p>", "<p>The phenomenon has brought upheaval for local communities. As the water has pushed further inland, grazing fields have continued to shrink and churches, schools and hospitals that were in use at the start of the year now lie in ruins. </p>", "<p>\u201cTake a boat ride here and chances are that you will be riding on top of multi-storey buildings, the relics of a lost city,\u201d says Francis Cherutich, a tour guide in Baringo.</p>", "<p>For 83-year-old Kangogo Arap Kipotota, his small grocery shop at Kampi Ya Samaki township doubles as his home. His former house lies submerged several miles from the shop. He remembers the lake swelling in 1961, but nowhere near the current levels. Back then, it was a long walk to get to the lake. Now it is almost at his shop. Like other residents, he fears he may have to move to higher ground again.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe lake was so far out that I would graze our sheep and goats beyond that tree,\u201d he says, pointing to a tree trunk more than 500 metres from his shop. \u201cWe would walk in the shallow edges of the lake. You cannot try that now since crocodiles and hippos have become our closet neighbours.\u201d</p>", "<p>Both lakes are Important bird areas that attract thousands of ornithologists from all over the world.

Hotels and lodges that relied on tourism have been either partly or completely submerged. At Soi Safari Lodge in Baringo, the only visible part of a hall styled after the traditional African hut is the roof. As recently as July, the building stood 800 metres away from the original lake\u2019s shoreline.</p>", "<p>\u201cCovid-19 took away the hotel business. Now the lake has taken the hotel. And there seems to be no end to the lake\u2019s encroachment on the properties,\u201d says Peter Chebii, a manager at the hotel.</p>", "<p>With no sign of the waters receding, Boitt warns: \u201cWe have failed to protect the environment and are now reaping the bitter fruits.

The financing allowed the group behind the railway \u2013 the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition \u2013 to kick off a federally mandated environmental impact survey, that would need to be completed before construction could begin.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">There was just one problem: the grant came from a pot of money set aside to help Utahns recover from the state\u2019s legacy of oil drilling, not help the industry expand deeper into the state.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Established in 1982, the Utah Permanent Community Impact Fund \u201cwas supposed to alleviate the boom and bust cycle of energy production,\u201d said Wendy Park, a lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Park believes that the $28m grant violates the spirit of the fund, which has provided money for a range of municipal projects like new sewer systems, medical facilities, road improvement and new public buildings.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The CBD, along with the Utah-based environmental group Living Rivers, is suing to stop the municipal agency from funding the $1.5bn railroad. The suit asks a fundamental question: is the development of yet more fossil fuel infrastructure the best way to help rural communities thrive?</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Two weeks ago, a judge ruled that this unique case had standing and would proceed. If successful, the suit could send a message to state agencies to more carefully consider the projects they fund and the impact they\u2019ll have.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Under the Trump administration, the oil and gas industry has enjoyed an increasingly cozy relationship with the federal agencies that oversee the nation\u2019s public lands. The proposed Uinta Basin railway could take one of three potential routes \u2013 the favored of which would plow through 390 acres of state lands and 401 acres of roadless US Forest Service lands.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The Utah permanent community impact fund collects royalties collected from mineral leasing. Although the fund\u2019s mandate is rather broad, the intention was to return some of the profits back to the community. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Sometimes this has meant helping cities experiencing an influx of workers expand their infrastructure to support these new residents, but it could also mean repairing roads damaged by a sudden increase in use by oil tankers. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"> The outcome of the Living Rivers lawsuit is unlikely to delay or stop construction, as it only challenges the source of the funding.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, which describes itself as a \u201cpublic implementation and ownership entity\u201d, has demonstrated its interest in aiding the oil and gas industry. It currently has twelve other projects in the works, about half which are directly related to fossil fuel production.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The coalition argues the Uinta Basin railway will bring jobs, raise municipal revenues, increase roadway safety and diversify the economy.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But the Covid-19 pandemic has also underlined the need for better healthcare infrastructure Utah\u2019s rural communities, something residents and activists say the community fund would be better off financing today.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cIt\u2019s important that the local governments get this money,\u201d and not fossil fuel corporations, says Park, \u201cespecially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when many are struggling\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Residents who live in regions the railway will run through oppose the construction as well.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Darrell Fordham of the Argyle Valley is concerned about potential erosion and mudslides from construction, as well as wildfires ignited by train\u2019s sparks. Where he lives, there is no alert system for residents, and roads are tight. \u201cMany people could easily be trapped in wildfire,\u201d he says.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Fordham suggested the fund could be used instead to \u201cdo municipal utility projects [or] build community centers and smaller health clinics\u201d. He says most of the nearby healthcare facilities only have a handful of ICU beds, which has been a problem as Covid-19 cases increase in Utah.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">This isn\u2019t the first time the Utah permanent community impact fund has come under scrutiny for how funds were disbursed. Earlier this year, a state audit found much of the money in the fund has gone to building fossil-fuel exclusive infrastructure, like highways that only benefit energy companies and a proposed (but scuttled) investment in a coal terminal in Oakland, California, that would export coal across the Pacific and theoretically raise coal prices in Utah.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The audit labeled the proposed Uinta Basin railway as an example of how the funds could be misappropriated, noting there was no way to ensure it \u201cadequately alleviate mineral extraction impact\u201d. The audit also found that the Utah permanent community impact fund was too opaque; it didn\u2019t do enough to do public outreach about the availability of the funds.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Finally, the audit found that the fund\u2019s $5m cap on grants had routinely been ignored, as well as a stipulation that every grant must be matched equally by grantees. In the case of the $28m granted to the SCIC \u2013 a group that has no fiscal income from taxes and can\u2019t apply for loans \u2013 the group put up no money, says Park from CBD.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Proponents of the railway argue that the project will benefit the community by taking tanker trucks off the roads, increasing local government incomes, and bringing jobs to the area. A railway connection might boost the price of the oil produced in the Uinta Basin; and, according to Kathleen Clarke, the head of Utah\u2019s public lands policy office, would feed into a trust fund established for schools.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">And yet it\u2019s unclear whether investing in fossil fuel production in the Uinta Basin can really pay off: John Weisheit, the co-founder of Living Rivers, says there isn\u2019t enough oil in the basin to make the investment worth it. The oil will likely be gone within ten years, if oil is extracted at 2019 rates, according to a study commissioned by the SCIC.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe economic viability of the railway is doubtful,\u201d said Park, \u201cwhich is probably why private investors have never developed this railway on their own and public subsidies are required\u201d.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Opponents of the railway argue it has environmental impacts as well. It will disturb sensitive sage grouse mating grounds, and destroy 10,000 acres of big game habitat for elk, mule deer, moose, bighorn sheep and pronghorn. </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The use of public money for the development of a potentially unprofitable railway is particularly bad at a time when states and municipalities are struggling because of the economic downturn.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">In the case of the Uinta Basin railway, Park said, the funding appears to do the opposite of its intended purpose: taking proceeds from drilling and returning it to the industry, rather than using it to help communities . \u201cThey pretty much give the money back to the fossil fuel companies.\u201d</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fiona-harvey"], "tags": ["Climate change,Paris climate agreement,Biden administration,Joe Biden,US news,World news,Greenhouse gas emissions,Global climate talks,Environment,US politics"], "title": ["US to hold world climate summit early next year and seek to rejoin Paris accord"], "date": ["2020-12-14T07:00:29.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p>Action points for first 100 days of Joe Biden presidency seen as boost to international action currently falling behind </p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The US will hold a climate summit of the world\u2019s major economies early next year, within 100 days of Joe Biden taking office, and seek to rejoin the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Paris agreement</a> on the first day of his presidency, in a boost to international climate action.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Leaders from 75 countries met without the US in a virtual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/12/un-secretary-general-all-countries-declare-climate-emergencies-antonio-guterres-climate-ambition-summit\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Climate Ambition Summit</a> co-hosted by the UN, the UK and France at the weekend, marking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/08/the-paris-agreement-five-years-on-is-it-strong-enough-to-avert-climate-catastrophe\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">fifth anniversary of the Paris accord</a>.

It is an effective way of getting access to other healthy individuals. Scientists think the fungi could be producing substances that \u201cdope\u201d their hosts (sometimes colloquially referred to as \u201czombies\u201d), meaning they can stay fresh enough to live for days after infection \u2013 only collapsing once there is nothing left in their abdomens but the fungus.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWe suspect therefore that these fungi may produce amphetamine-like substances which keep a fly\u2019s energy levels high up until the end,\u201d said lead researcher Prof J\u00f8rgen Eilenberg from the department of plant and environmental Sciences at the University of Copenhagen. Researchers also believe the fungi produce substances that keep microorganisms away from the fly fungal wound and keep it clean, but they are yet to test this.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThey work like small rockets,\u201d said Eilenberg. \u201cThey are almost shaped like torpedoes and are designed for going fast.\u201d If they land on another fly they stick to the cuticle and then wiggle their way into the abdomen, where they start to proliferate. Thousands of spores will be released out from a single fly.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The parasites probably only infect a small percentage of individuals \u2013 between 3 and 5% in a healthy fly population. Because the host continues to behave normally it is difficult to identify when it has been infected, which is why AHT is relatively under-researched. It has only been discovered in two complete genera \u2013 strongwellsea and a similar fungal genus called massospora, which uses <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/science/cicadas-fungus-butts.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">cicadas</a> in a similar way.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><em>Strongwellsea tigrinae </em>was discovered by Eilenberg in 1993 in North Zealand in eastern Denmark. <em>Strongwellsea acerosa </em>was first seen in a residential area in greater Copenhagen by one of his students, Dorthe Britt Tiwald, in 1998. Both have only now been officially declared new species. There are now a total of five known species of strongwellsea.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Dr Matthew Kasson, an associate professor of forest pathology and mycology at West Virginia University, who was not involved in this latest research, agrees strongwellsea may be producing the same \u201cdope\u201d compound as massospora, which <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190625173456.htm\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">he has researched</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear how many species we have but I really think we\u2019ve just scratched the surface,\u201d he says.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe reason this discovery is important is because we can\u2019t make broad, sweeping conclusions about host manipulation and behavioural modification based on a single genus. Having a second genus like strongwellsea, which induces the same behavioural response, is important in solving this bigger puzzle of active host transmission \u2026 Collectively, this group of insect-destroying fungi may represent the next frontier for drug discovery.\u201d</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["PA Media"], "tags": ["Environment,Flooding,UK news,UK weather,Climate change"], "title": ["UK warned to prepare for risk of winter flooding"], "date": ["2020-12-15T16:52:12.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p>Environment Agency urges people in flood zones to plan ahead as Met Office forecasts wet January and February</p>", "<p class=\"css-vdb1rb\">Last modified on Tue 15 Dec 2020 19.36 GMT</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The next couple of months are likely to be wetter than normal in the UK, experts have warned, raising the prospect of flooding.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The Environment Agency\u2019s executive director of operations, John Curtin, said teams around the country were prepared for dealing with floods this winter in a Covid-safe way.</p>", "<p id=\"sign-in-gate\"></p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">But he urged people to check if they were at risk and prepare for potential flooding, to protect precious keepsakes such as photographs and reduce the mental health impacts of the trauma of being flooded.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">He also warned of the challenge of keeping up with the rapidly increasing flood threat posed by climate change.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Will Lang, the head of civil contingencies at the Met Office, said that after an unsettled December, with rain and wind continuing into next week, there would be colder, drier weather over Christmas and into the new year.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cBeyond that, though, our longer range forecasts for January and February have been consistently suggesting that wetter, windier and milder conditions are more likely than normal, so that wet weather will return again,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Groundwater levels are slightly above normal and there is not much capacity in the soil to take more rain, leaving the country more \u201cin the gift of the weather\u201d, Curtin said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">While the forecast was not certain, it needed to be taken seriously in case of more wet weather on top of the current conditions, he said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Curtin said the Environment Agency had carried out repair work or put measures in place to protect communities where defences were damaged by floods brought on by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/23/uk-weather-flooded-communities-warned-of-more-heavy-rain\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">record wet conditions in February</a>, which flooded 8,000 properties.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Equipment that includes 25 miles of temporary flood barriers and 250 high-volume pumps was ready to be deployed, and 1,500 military personnel and 6,500 Environment Agency staff were trained to handle floods this winter.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/02/uk-weather-storm-alex-batters-south-west-england-with-gale-force-winds\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Storms Aiden and Alex</a> earlier this year had allowed teams to test their response under Covid-19 conditions, including putting out kit in a safe way, setting up virtual incident rooms and using local support to avoid moving people around the country, he said.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWe have done a lot of preparedness, a lot of testing to make sure we can still respond this winter under Covid conditions, but it\u2019s really important that people prepare their own flood risk.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">He urged householders to take time to prepare for the possibility of flooding, which he said would be beneficial to their mental health.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Local emergency response teams have planned for managing evacuations in a Covid-safe way, he said, adding that the potential risk of the virus would be secondary to a threat to life in a flooding situation.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cAll of that has been well rehearsed, it\u2019s just whether or not people are aware of that.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is people\u2019s hesitancy to leave if their life is in danger from an immediate approaching flood, worrying about what the Covid risk is, so that\u2019s one of the elements we will have to keep communicating through this winter.\u201d</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Lang also urged people to keep up to date with weather forecasts and warnings.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">He said changes to lives because of the pandemic, such as being less used to driving in winter conditions, could make people more vulnerable.

Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</p>", "<p>The whitewashed cottage belongs to Sheldrake\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s mother and when she started renting it 36 years ago there was a tree growing through the kitchen. The week before my visit an oak nearly crushed the shepherd\u2019s hut (transformed into an office). Sheldrake is as eccentric as you\u2019d expect, given that he is the son of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/05/rupert-sheldrake-interview-science-delusion\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">maverick biologist Rupert</a>, and brother to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/merlin-sheldrake\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">fungi expert Merlin</a>. Musically, he is most influenced by his mother, Jill Purce, who teaches and practises Mongolian overtone chanting.</p>", "<p>On the walls inside the cottage is a kaleidoscope of paintings, mainly depicting views from around the house (his girlfriend\u2019s mother is the artist Lizzie Wallace). Sheldrake, who is normally London-based, doesn\u2019t drive so it\u2019s convenient that his source of inspiration comes from the woods hugging the house. These paintings are a visual reflection of the landscape, while Sheldrake\u2019s album is a reflection of the noises it makes.</p>", "<p>His studio-cum-field-station is a metre from a bird feeder. Inside the studio is a bed, an armchair and a scruffy collection of boxes. He puts the sound recordings into his computer and slows down individual calls. It\u2019s like intercepting morse code, revealing delicate cadences you don\u2019t hear when the songs are rattled out at speed. The blackbird is a guttural, gritty character, while the robin\u2019s voice has bell-like purity.</p>", "<p>\u201cBirds live on a different time axis,\u201d says 30-year-old Sheldrake. \u201cThere\u2019s a spectrum of relationships with time \u2013 we look at birds and think they\u2019re very \u2018other\u2019, but when you slow their song down, you get an idea of the tapestry of what they\u2019re saying and they sound strangely human. These are very subtle, integrated phrases that we miss when they\u2019re singing at their normal speed.\u201d</p>", "<p>And so these little characters and conversations have been pieced together in an album that follows the natural acoustics of the day; it starts with a nightjar, which sings just after dusk and through the night, then goes to a nightingale, and then the dawn chorus, before working its way through the day. A chord can be composed of five or six different aspects of a song played simultaneously. Tracks are based on sounds that already exist and have their own identity and character. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaboration,\u201d says Sheldrake, \u201cexcept without explicit consent from the birds.\u201d</p>", "<p>Beech woodland where the cottage can be found in Hampshire. Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</p>", "<p>At first, Sheldrake made songs as Christmas presents for friends and family to use as alarm clocks. People who got them then found they couldn\u2019t sleep through the actual dawn chorus because they had tuned into it. Sheldrake wanted more people to be conscious of bird sounds so he decided to make an album. </p>", "<p>\u201cOnce you can identify them as species or individuals, it just turns into this completely insane conversation across huge amounts of time and space,\u201d says Sheldrake. \u201cYou have these themes essentially rippling through the woods. Everything that happens in a woodland is like a stone dropping into a pond. It sends out these ripples as those birds respond and then respond to those responses \u2026 there are so many layers and levels to it,\u201d he says.</p>", "<p>A mistle thrush, which is widespread in the UK but was added to the red list of endangered species in 2015. Photograph: blickwinkel/Alamy</p>", "<p>Part of his aim is to highlight how we may not be conscious of the loss of wildlife from our lives. Many of the birds featured on his album, such as marsh warbler, mistle thrush and dunnock, are no longer a ubiquitous part of our soundscapes. The star performers from today\u2019s chorus \u2013 blackbirds and robins \u2013 didn\u2019t make it on to Sheldrake\u2019s album because they are not (yet) on the <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/globalassets/downloads/join-and-donate/appeals/birds-on-the-red-list.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">red or amber list of endangered British birds</a>.</p>", "<p>We go on a sonic field trip in the forest around the house, walking through old plantations \u2013 the beech woodland, with its dark canopy and little plant growth on the forest floor, sounds like a cathedral. Sheldrake describes it as a \u201cslow, crashing surf sound, like an ocean\u201d.

Birds have evolved acoustic as well as physical niches \u2013 and they use different frequencies and rhythms so they can still identify individuals. Historically, the sonic landscape has been underrepresented in research, but a new wave of acoustic ecologists are paying more attention to sound, led by the US musician and soundscape ecologist <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/guardianscienceweekly/soundscape-ecology-with\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Dr Bernie Krause</a>. Listening to the voices of the natural world propels that experience into another dimension, says Krause.</p>", "<p>The red-listed marsh warbler (top left) and amber-listed dunnock both feature on Cosmo Sheldrake\u2019s digital album <a href=\"https://cosmosheldrake.bandcamp.com/album/wake-up-calls-2\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Wake Up Calls</a>.

They speak to the health of a habitat. They tell us how we\u2019re doing in relationship to our environment. And they can serve as analgesics in these unsettling and stressful times.\u201d</p>", "<p>As well as raising awareness about loss of natural sounds, Sheldrake has always liked the idea of \u201cplaying places\u201d \u2013 playing songs back to the place they came from. He didn\u2019t know this could potentially be beneficial until he looked at the work of Prof Steve Simpson from the University of Exeter on \u201csonic enrichment\u201d, in which the sounds of healthy ocean reefs are played into degraded areas in order to attract life back to them.</p>", "<p>Within forest environments, sound is a critical method of communication \u2013 birds have evolved acoustic as well as physical niches. Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</p>", "<p>According to research published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13186-2\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">Nature Communications</a> last year, playing the sound of a healthy reef into a degraded and abandoned one can lure fish back to the area. Blasting \u201cgolden oldies\u201d back on to a reef is like \u201cputting it on steroids\u201d, says Simpson.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s not known whether a similar approach might work with birds. Krause believes that playing bird sounds back into a habitat risks stressing out organisms that have already carved out an acoustic niche for themselves.

It is an effective way of getting access to other healthy individuals. Scientists think the fungi could be producing substances that \u201cdope\u201d their hosts (sometimes colloquially referred to as \u201czombies\u201d), meaning they can stay fresh enough to live for days after infection \u2013 only collapsing once there is nothing left in their abdomens but the fungus.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cWe suspect therefore that these fungi may produce amphetamine-like substances which keep a fly\u2019s energy levels high up until the end,\u201d said lead researcher Prof J\u00f8rgen Eilenberg from the department of plant and environmental Sciences at the University of Copenhagen. Researchers also believe the fungi produce substances that keep microorganisms away from the fly fungal wound and keep it clean, but they are yet to test this.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThey work like small rockets,\u201d said Eilenberg. \u201cThey are almost shaped like torpedoes and are designed for going fast.\u201d If they land on another fly they stick to the cuticle and then wiggle their way into the abdomen, where they start to proliferate. Thousands of spores will be released out from a single fly.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">The parasites probably only infect a small percentage of individuals \u2013 between 3 and 5% in a healthy fly population. Because the host continues to behave normally it is difficult to identify when it has been infected, which is why AHT is relatively under-researched. It has only been discovered in two complete genera \u2013 strongwellsea and a similar fungal genus called massospora, which uses <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/science/cicadas-fungus-butts.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">cicadas</a> in a similar way.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\"><em>Strongwellsea tigrinae </em>was discovered by Eilenberg in 1993 in North Zealand in eastern Denmark. <em>Strongwellsea acerosa </em>was first seen in a residential area in greater Copenhagen by one of his students, Dorthe Britt Tiwald, in 1998. Both have only now been officially declared new species. There are now a total of five known species of strongwellsea.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">Dr Matthew Kasson, an associate professor of forest pathology and mycology at West Virginia University, who was not involved in this latest research, agrees strongwellsea may be producing the same \u201cdope\u201d compound as massospora, which <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190625173456.htm\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">he has researched</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear how many species we have but I really think we\u2019ve just scratched the surface,\u201d he says.</p>", "<p class=\"css-38z03z\">\u201cThe reason this discovery is important is because we can\u2019t make broad, sweeping conclusions about host manipulation and behavioural modification based on a single genus. Having a second genus like strongwellsea, which induces the same behavioural response, is important in solving this bigger puzzle of active host transmission \u2026 Collectively, this group of insect-destroying fungi may represent the next frontier for drug discovery.\u201d</p>"]}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/10/birdwatch-the-swallow-my-favourite-bird-has-left-to-enjoy-a-second-summer", "author": ["PA Media"], "tags": ["Environment,Flooding,UK news,UK weather,Climate change"], "title": ["UK warned to prepare for risk of winter flooding"], "date": ["2020-12-15T16:52:12.000Z"], "images": [], "body": ["<p>The next couple of months are likely to be wetter than normal in the UK, experts have warned, raising the prospect of flooding.</p>", "<p>The Environment Agency\u2019s executive director of operations, John Curtin, said teams around the country were prepared for dealing with floods this winter in a Covid-safe way.</p>", "<p>But he urged people to check if they were at risk and prepare for potential flooding, to protect precious keepsakes such as photographs and reduce the mental health impacts of the trauma of being flooded.</p>", "<p>He also warned of the challenge of keeping up with the rapidly increasing flood threat posed by climate change.</p>", "<p>Will Lang, the head of civil contingencies at the Met Office, said that after an unsettled December, with rain and wind continuing into next week, there would be colder, drier weather over Christmas and into the new year.</p>", "<p>\u201cBeyond that, though, our longer range forecasts for January and February have been consistently suggesting that wetter, windier and milder conditions are more likely than normal, so that wet weather will return again,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p>Groundwater levels are slightly above normal and there is not much capacity in the soil to take more rain, leaving the country more \u201cin the gift of the weather\u201d, Curtin said.</p>", "<p>While the forecast was not certain, it needed to be taken seriously in case of more wet weather on top of the current conditions, he said.</p>", "<p>Curtin said the Environment Agency had carried out repair work or put measures in place to protect communities where defences were damaged by floods brought on by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/23/uk-weather-flooded-communities-warned-of-more-heavy-rain\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">record wet conditions in February</a>, which flooded 8,000 properties.</p>", "<p>Equipment that includes 25 miles of temporary flood barriers and 250 high-volume pumps was ready to be deployed, and 1,500 military personnel and 6,500 Environment Agency staff were trained to handle floods this winter.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/02/uk-weather-storm-alex-batters-south-west-england-with-gale-force-winds\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline\">Storms Aiden and Alex</a> earlier this year had allowed teams to test their response under Covid-19 conditions, including putting out kit in a safe way, setting up virtual incident rooms and using local support to avoid moving people around the country, he said.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe have done a lot of preparedness, a lot of testing to make sure we can still respond this winter under Covid conditions, but it\u2019s really important that people prepare their own flood risk.\u201d</p>", "<p>He urged householders to take time to prepare for the possibility of flooding, which he said would be beneficial to their mental health.</p>", "<p>Local emergency response teams have planned for managing evacuations in a Covid-safe way, he said, adding that the potential risk of the virus would be secondary to a threat to life in a flooding situation.</p>", "<p>\u201cAll of that has been well rehearsed, it\u2019s just whether or not people are aware of that.</p>", "<p>\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is people\u2019s hesitancy to leave if their life is in danger from an immediate approaching flood, worrying about what the Covid risk is, so that\u2019s one of the elements we will have to keep communicating through this winter.\u201d</p>", "<p>Lang also urged people to keep up to date with weather forecasts and warnings.</p>", "<p>He said changes to lives because of the pandemic, such as being less used to driving in winter conditions, could make people more vulnerable.

Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</p>", "<p>The whitewashed cottage belongs to Sheldrake\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s mother and when she started renting it 36 years ago there was a tree growing through the kitchen. The week before my visit an oak nearly crushed the shepherd\u2019s hut (transformed into an office). Sheldrake is as eccentric as you\u2019d expect, given that he is the son of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/05/rupert-sheldrake-interview-science-delusion\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">maverick biologist Rupert</a>, and brother to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/merlin-sheldrake\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\">fungi expert Merlin</a>. Musically, he is most influenced by his mother, Jill Purce, who teaches and practises Mongolian overtone chanting.</p>", "<p>On the walls inside the cottage is a kaleidoscope of paintings, mainly depicting views from around the house (his girlfriend\u2019s mother is the artist Lizzie Wallace). Sheldrake, who is normally London-based, doesn\u2019t drive so it\u2019s convenient that his source of inspiration comes from the woods hugging the house. These paintings are a visual reflection of the landscape, while Sheldrake\u2019s album is a reflection of the noises it makes.</p>", "<p>His studio-cum-field-station is a metre from a bird feeder. Inside the studio is a bed, an armchair and a scruffy collection of boxes. He puts the sound recordings into his computer and slows down individual calls. It\u2019s like intercepting morse code, revealing delicate cadences you don\u2019t hear when the songs are rattled out at speed. The blackbird is a guttural, gritty character, while the robin\u2019s voice has bell-like purity.</p>", "<p>\u201cBirds live on a different time axis,\u201d says 30-year-old Sheldrake. \u201cThere\u2019s a spectrum of relationships with time \u2013 we look at birds and think they\u2019re very \u2018other\u2019, but when you slow their song down, you get an idea of the tapestry of what they\u2019re saying and they sound strangely human. These are very subtle, integrated phrases that we miss when they\u2019re singing at their normal speed.\u201d</p>", "<p>And so these little characters and conversations have been pieced together in an album that follows the natural acoustics of the day; it starts with a nightjar, which sings just after dusk and through the night, then goes to a nightingale, and then the dawn chorus, before working its way through the day. A chord can be composed of five or six different aspects of a song played simultaneously. Tracks are based on sounds that already exist and have their own identity and character. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaboration,\u201d says Sheldrake, \u201cexcept without explicit consent from the birds.\u201d</p>", "<p>Beech woodland where the cottage can be found in Hampshire. Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</p>", "<p>At first, Sheldrake made songs as Christmas presents for friends and family to use as alarm clocks. People who got them then found they couldn\u2019t sleep through the actual dawn chorus because they had tuned into it. Sheldrake wanted more people to be conscious of bird sounds so he decided to make an album. </p>", "<p>\u201cOnce you can identify them as species or individuals, it just turns into this completely insane conversation across huge amounts of time and space,\u201d says Sheldrake. \u201cYou have these themes essentially rippling through the woods. Everything that happens in a woodland is like a stone dropping into a pond. It sends out these ripples as those birds respond and then respond to those responses \u2026 there are so many layers and levels to it,\u201d he says.</p>", "<p>A mistle thrush, which is widespread in the UK but was added to the red list of endangered species in 2015. Photograph: blickwinkel/Alamy</p>", "<p>Part of his aim is to highlight how we may not be conscious of the loss of wildlife from our lives.

Birds have evolved acoustic as well as physical niches \u2013 and they use different frequencies and rhythms so they can still identify individuals.

They speak to the health of a habitat. They tell us how we\u2019re doing in relationship to our environment. And they can serve as analgesics in these unsettling and stressful times.\u201d</p>", "<p>As well as raising awareness about loss of natural sounds, Sheldrake has always liked the idea of \u201cplaying places\u201d \u2013 playing songs back to the place they came from. He didn\u2019t know this could potentially be beneficial until he looked at the work of Prof Steve Simpson from the University of Exeter on \u201csonic enrichment\u201d, in which the sounds of healthy ocean reefs are played into degraded areas in order to attract life back to them.</p>", "<p>Within forest environments, sound is a critical method of communication \u2013 birds have evolved acoustic as well as physical niches.
